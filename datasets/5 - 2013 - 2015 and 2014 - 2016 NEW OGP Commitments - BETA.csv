,2,Sweden,Commitment 1: Putting citizens at the centre (eGovernment) of government administration reforms,"The commitment on putting citizens at the centre (eGovernment) aims to make everyday
life easier, open up administration in order to support innovation and participation, and increase operational quality and effectiveness as stated in the eGovernment strategy
‘Putting the citizen at the centre’. The strategy has three objectives:
- simplicity, in order to develop easy and user-friendly solutions;
- transparency and innovation, in order to take advantage of digital opportunities to increase transparency, strengthen democracy, and contribute to increased economic growth through open data; and
- increased efficiency through digitisation.
Transparency and openness are crucial to democratic accountability. Therefore transparency and access to information about government administration are vital. Supplying public sector information and digital services in standardised formats allows businesses and organisations to re-use it and to develop their own services. These services can supplement the range of services delivered by government agencies and meet diverse civic needs. The commitment will mainly be achieved through continuing the implementation of the eGovernment strategy ‘Putting the citizen at the centre’ including strengthening the governance of the digitisation efforts of the government administration.
Main activities
- Develop a multi-annual reform-programme to be presented in Budget bill for 2015, called the Digital move in order to achieve the objectives of the Putting the citizen at the centre strategy, as well as support other public digitisation efforts.
- Appoint an inquiry to investigate how an improved governance of public digital information can improve the efficiency, transparency and innovation in the public sector, as a part of the eGovernment reform-programme.
- Promote the use of open data and agencies to release more data.
- Promote and coordinate","Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications.",Government agencies such as Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation systems (VINNOVA) and The Swedish E-identification Board which consists of both public and private sector representatives.

,2,Sweden,Commitment 2: A step further on the re-use of public administration documents,"The commitment on a step further on the re-use of public administration documents aims to enhance economic growth, greater openness and better service for citizens. Various estimates point to considerable value for society when the re-use of public administration documents is increased. When information from the public sector is being re-used, compiled, processed and made available, the ability of citizens to gain insight and make demands on government activities increases. A more open government can increase its legitimacy among citizens and their willingness to participate in the development of the service level, efficiency and quality of public services. The commitment will mainly be achieved through changes in Swedish legislation, proposed by a Government Inquiry and actions to promote and monitor the re-use of public administration documents.
Main activities
- Prepare for changes in the Act on the re-use of public administration documents (2010:566) in order to implement the Directive 2013/37/EU (Public Sector Information Directive).7
- Support initiatives related to the project ‘Application profile for data portals in
Europe’ (DCAT-AP), where Sweden participates.8
- Continue to facilitate actions in order to promote agencies’ re-use of public administration documents at different levels.
- Improve comprehensive follow-up and monitoring, including continuing to systematically give missions to agencies to report on their work on re-using public administration documents.

,2,Sweden,Commitment 3: Increased access to Swedish aid information,"The commitment on increased access to Swedish aid information aims to increase the transparency of aid spending and performance. Transparent information is a prerequisite for open debate and public participation, and facilitates accountability to citizens and organisations in partner countries and to Swedish taxpayers. More accessible information also provides a better basis for decisions and visibility of aid results, and limits the scope for corruption and misuse of resources. The commitment will be achieved mainly through further development of the Openaid.se platform. Improved IATI reporting will also
result in improvements in Openaid.se.
Main activities
- Follow up the implementation of the transparency guarantee in Swedish aid in order to ensure that relevant routines are in place.
- Update Sweden’s Common Standard implementation schedule in order to further extend and broaden Sweden’s IATI reporting.
- Further develop the Openaid.se platform in order to extend and improve data quality, accessibility and usability.
The activities will mainly be performed by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), based on several existing assignments and related working plans. In addition, the implementation of the Swedish
aid transparency guarantee applies to all public actors who have been allocated development assistance funds.

The administration of benefits is hindered by inadequate capacity, lack of information system,
supervision and controls. Albania currently has no national electronic registry of economic

assistance seekers and the administration of receiving welfare benefits takes place locally with
paper documentation. This consequently leads to (a) inefficiency in the application and granting
of benefits (higher transaction costs), (b) weaknesses in supervision and control of fraud and
error, and (c) monitoring and evaluation of ineffective social policy.

the challenges in response to which Georgian government started to develop community centers

Carefully selected and trained local staff ensures provision of the central government’s, municipal and private sector services through e-Governance. The CCs host Trustee’s office (municipality representative on village level). Furthermore, there is a special space for meetings and conference rooms for promoting civic engagement activities. Local population has an opportunity to access free internet, computers, and video conference equipment, together with ATM and Pay Boxes.
Development of Community Centers in Georgia ensures provision of demanded private sector services to the local population at the village level. CCs provide citizens with opportunity to interact with Government and receive up to 200 public services locally without the need to travel outside the village.
Currently 12 Community Centers are fully operational across Georgia. Construction of 6 additional CCs is planned throughout 2014 which will increase the number of local inhabitants participating in local decision-making processes.","Public Service Development Agency (LEPL), Ministry of Justice of

As part of the pilot project 10 service processes falling under the competencies of local government have been analyzed and based on this a Municipal Services Management System was developed. During 2014 the agency plans to introduce the system in 6 selected pilot municipalities (Kareli, Tetritskaro, Xashuri, Khobi, Akhmeta, and Gardabani). To meet the demands of the new software the necessary trainings for the municipality personnel will be organized.
As a result of engaging the local government into the unified e-Governance system their processes and practices will become more transparent, efficient and effective. The municipalities will have an access to the existing electronic databases (Public Service Development Agency, National Agency of Public Registry, Social Service Agency and other Central Government or Private Company databases), resulting in reduced time and human resources and decreasing costs related to data
collection, processing and verification within self-government offices.
All services available through the new electronic system will be integrated in the Citizen’s Portal - my.gov.ge. Additionally, PSDA will conduct a survey to study the interests and informational needs of the local population and based on the findings design a new web-portal to post information on Municipality and Community Center activities.
During 2014-2015 e-Governance will be implemented in 4 additional municipalities. It is also envisaged to increase the number of services selected at the initial phase of the project, study additional services and embed relevant procedures into the electronic municipal service management system.","Public Service Development Agency (LEPL), Ministry of Justice of

This commitment implies the use of public libraries with new functions: along with the traditional purposes libraries will acquire functions of Community Centers. Thus, libraries will serve as additional  opportunity  to  increase  capacity  of  communities  and  local  governments.  Trained librarians through modern technologies (internet, computer technologies, and new books) will ensure high quality service delivery for local population.
The project aims to ensure access to public information and better communication between citizens and the local governments as well. It will improve the level of civic engagement and capacity of local librarians through e-governance and modern technologies on the regional level.
The pilot project will be implemented in 2014. It will cover 4 public libraries. Based on the pilot work will continue in 2015.

,2,Georgia,Commitment 7: Digital Signature and Online Authentication,"To develop identification services in Georgia, the Public Service Development Agency in the framework of Open Government Georgia’s National Action plan of 2014-2015 commits itself to focus on two major components in the area:
1.   Online Authentication System development by means of electronic ID card and relevant authentication mechanisms integrated in it.
2.   Digital Signature and Stamp (e-Seal), aiming at development of electronic document-flow systems  in  Georgia  through  creation  and  overhauling  of  the  mechanisms  for  digital signature and digital stamp (digital signature on behalf of an organization).
Development of identification services will simplify the internal procedures for organizations through reducing paper-based work. It will also improve service delivery for citizens, enabling them to sign relevant documents without leaving their homes.
Digital stamp will support organizations to easily perform signature of relevant documents (e.g. pre-agreed contracts) and, on the other hand, will create additional incentives for the development of personal digital signatures, as nowadays the majority of contracts requiring personal signature indicate organization as a second party to the contract (employment contracts, bank service contracts, etc.). It is noteworthy that demand for these types of digital services comes from its potential users (banks, Notary Chamber and etc.).
Hence,  the  main  objective  of  the  initiative  is  to  contribute  to  the  development  of  e-services, gradually replace paper documents with electronic ones in formal relations and thus, increase the effectiveness and transparency of official processes.
The implementation of the project will lead to improved public services by enabling citizens to receive relevant official documents (e.g. birth certificates, diplomas, etc.) in a digital format, thus, resulting in major paper and printing cost savings and expedited citizen services.

The special act will emphasize openness policy of the government and will ease the work of the professionals involved in the area.
Ministry of Justice of Georgia will coordinate elaboration of freedom of information law in close cooperation with civil society. In order to ensure broad consultation process and wide involvement of stakeholders a special working group will be created. Based on consultations and international expertise the special working group will elaborate the new provisions of freedom of information in compliance with international standards.

There is a Code of Conduct for all public officials and other regulations, however, adherence and popularization leaves much to be desired which adversely affects corruption. It is expected that the development of the Pacts will promote ethical and proactive performance by public officials in the discharge of their duties especially in delivering key public services in an effort to improve accountability. Actions Required/Milestones for Completion:
a) ￼Dissemination, administration and enforcement of existing integrity ￼policies to improve public trust strengthened.
b) ￼5 pilot MDAs selected to sign an integrity pact with ACC on key ￼commitments to reduce corruption in their Institutions.

By setting specific performance requirements, the Government aims to ensure that the benefits that Sierra Leone seeks to obtain from FDI including improved technology and managerial skills are integrated into the domestic market and distribution networks. There are key facilitative commitments that are already prescribed by the LCP such as the establishment of an implementing committee; however, it is currently not functional. And for us to proceed effectively; it needs to become more functional. Since key MDAs have a monitoring role to play, it is important that they understand their roles and responsibilities to implement the LCP. Moreover, MDAs should have collaborative meetings and share plans, revenue streams to enhance transparency and accountability.Actions Required/Milestones for Completion:

Following the preparation of the 2011 EITI report, a gap analysis was undertaken by Government institutions in collaboration with civil society organizations and one of the key areas of concern was the revision of contracts and making these documents public. While significant progress has been made on the revision of key mining contracts, some work is still required on making lease agreements and contracts public in an effort to promote transparency and encourage civic participation in the debate and execution of mining contracts. This commitment will create more access points for the public to these documents to engender national debate. Similar issues lie around agribusiness contracts and the level of concern is similar to that of mining companies. Actions Required/Milestones for Completion:

Encouraging the Private Sector to Utilze Public Data,"At the second Open Data Strategy Council held in April 2014 and composed of enterprises, civilian experts, etc., the “Execution Plan for the Provision and Promotion of Public Data” was passed. According to the plan, 504 types of key public data (identified through agency assessment and public feedback, notably via consultative/advisory bodies and user communities which most central and local government organizations have, with examples such as Open Data Partnership of the Gyeonggi Provincial Government and open data user community of the Ministry of Education), which are expected to have high demands and relatively a bigger impact on the society, will be selected and disclosed first. Not only that, a private-public consultative body whose members include the companies that use public data for their business will be operated in order to get feedback from the private sector and reflect their views on data sharing policies.
In this regard, the “Grand Open Forum for Public Data” was held in May 2014 along with about 400 experts from the private and public sectors. At the Forum, a private-public data-sharing task force team for each of the 16 strategic areas will be officially launched. The 16 task force teams are expected to act as communication channels between the government and civil society. The task force teams are headed by chief open data officers of government agencies involved who are responsible for releasing open data and nurturing companies that use open data in collaboration with the “Open Data Ecosystem Group.” The task force teams are coordinated by the MOSPA, the lead ministry on open data, and they are expected to hold meetings periodically (e.g. bi-monthly) and conferences (at least once a year) in an effort to analyze demanded data from the private sector and to consider the private sector’s opinions.
In addition, the Korean government will continue to work on evolving the best practices of the use of public data among private enterprises such as Naver (Naver Map), Daum (Daum Maps), SK Planet (security cameras, public transportation information, etc.), and Solideo Systems (building information) in a hope that more and more companies will utilize public data for their businesses.",,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

recognizing the value of the American public as a strategic partner in solving some of the country’s 
most difficult challenges. The United States is committed to continuing to expand public participation in 
government and will: 
- Expand and Simplify the Use of We the People. In 2014, the White House will introduce 
improvements to We the People that will make petitioning the Government easier and more 
effective. These improvements will enhance public participation by creating a more streamlined 
process for signing petitions and a new Application Programming Interface (API) that will allow 
third parties to collect and submit signatures to We the People petitions from their own 
websites. These improvements will also enhance transparency by enabling the public to perform 
data analysis on the signatures and petitions. The White House will publish a software 
development kit to help people build tools using the We the People API and will engage with the 
public on improvements to the API and expansion of its use.
- Publish Best Practices and Metrics for Public Participation. In the first National Action Plan, 
the Administration committed to identify best practices for public participation in government 
and to suggest metrics that would allow agencies to assess progress toward this goal. Over the 
past two years, the Administration consulted with the public, civil society stakeholders, and 
academics on how best to implement this initiative from the first National Action Plan. In 2014,

,2,USA,"Modernize the Freedom of Information Act
","3. Modernize the Freedom of Information Act
The Obama Administration has already made important progress to improve the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) process by simplifying the process of filing requests at many agencies, by 
proactively disclosing information in the public interest in advance of requests, by speeding up 
processing times, by greatly reducing FOIA backlogs, and by publishing more data on FOIA compliance. 
There is still much more that the Administration can do and the United States is committed to further 
modernizing FOIA processes through the following initiatives: 
Improve the Customer Experience through a Consolidated Online FOIA Service. More than 
100 Federal agencies are subject to FOIA. For the average requester, this can mean significant 
energy spent searching for the right agency and navigating the unique process for submitting a 
request to that agency. The Administration will launch a consolidated request portal that allows 
the public to submit a request to any Federal agency from a single website and includes 
additional tools to improve the customer experience. The U.S. Government will establish a FOIA
task force that will review current practices, seek public input, and determine the best way to 
implement this consolidated FOIA service.
- Develop Common FOIA Regulations and Practices for Federal Agencies. Certain steps in the 
FOIA process are generally shared across Federal agencies. Standardizing these common 
aspects through a core FOIA regulation and common set of practices would make it easier for 
requesters to understand and navigate the FOIA process and easier for the Government to keep 
regulations up to date. The Administration will initiate an interagency process to determine the 
feasibility and the potential content of a core FOIA regulation that is both applicable to all 
agencies and retains flexibility for agency-specific requirements.
-Improve Internal Agency FOIA Processes. Over the past few years, several agencies have 
analyzed existing FOIA practices and used this information to make dramatic improvements in 
their backlogs and processing times, as well as to increase the proactive release of information 
in the public interest. The U.S. Government will scale these targeted efforts to improve the 
efficiency of agencies with the biggest backlogs, and to share lessons learned to further improve 
internal agency FOIA processes.
-Establish a FOIA Modernization Advisory Committee. Improvements to FOIA administration must take into account the views and interests of both requesters and the Government. The United States will establish a formal FOIA Advisory Committee, comprised of government and non-governmental members of the FOIA community, to foster dialog between the Administration and the requester community, solicit public comments, and develop consensus recommendations for improving FOIA administration and proactive disclosures.
Improve FOIA Training Across Government to Increase Efficiency. In order to efficiently and effectively respond to FOIA requests, every Federal employee — not just those in an agency’s FOIA office — should fully understand the FOIA process. The Administration will make standard e-learning training resources available for FOIA professionals and other Federal employees and encourage their use.

Classification must therefore be kept to the minimum required to meet national security needs, and information should be made available to the public through proper declassification once the need for protecting the information has passed. In continuation of our efforts to transform the classification system and declassify as much material as possible, while simultaneously protecting national security, the Administration will:
-Create a Security Classification Reform Committee. The Public Interest Declassification Board, an advisory committee made up of experts outside government as well as former government classification experts, has made several recommendations for reducing overclassification and simplifying the classification system in its report, Transforming the Security Classification System. The interagency Classification Review Committee, which will report to the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, will review these recommendations, coordinate efforts to implement those that are accepted, and meet periodically with external stakeholders to obtain their input as appropriate.
-Systematically Review and Declassify Historical Data on Nuclear Activities. The Classification Review Committee will work with the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and Department of State to determine, consistent with applicable statutes, how to implement a systematic review process for the declassification of no-longer sensitive historical information on nuclear programs (Formerly Restricted Data or FRD), focusing on specific events and topics of historical nuclear policy interest and ways for the public to help identify priorities for declassification review.
- Pilot Technological Tools to Analyze Classified Presidential Records. The Central Intelligence Agency and NARA will pilot the use of new tools to provide classification reviewers with search capability for unstructured data and automate initial document analysis, beginning with Presidential Records from the Reagan Administration’s classified e-mail system.
-Implement Monitoring and Tracking of Declassification Reviews. The National Declassification Center at NARA will implement a referral and tracking system that will automatically notify appropriate agency representatives when classified records are ready for declassification review and enable monitoring to ensure that agencies meet review deadlines. This system will include records of Presidential Libraries.",,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly two thousand pages of documents have since been released, including materials that were provided to Congress in conjunction with its oversight and reauthorization of these authorities. As information is declassified, the U.S. Intelligence Community is posting online materials and other information relevant to FISA, the FISA Court, and oversight and compliance efforts. The Administration has further committed to:
-Share Data on the Use of National Security Legal Authorities. The Administration will release annual public reports on the U.S. Government’s use of certain national security authorities. These reports will include the total number of orders issued during the prior twelve-month period and the number of targets affected by them.
-Review and Declassify Information Regarding Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Programs. The Director of National Intelligence will continue to review and, where appropriate, declassify information related to foreign intelligence surveillance programs.

Federal law prohibits retaliation against most government employees and contractors who act as whistleblowers, and those protections were strengthened by recent legislation and Executive action. However, some who work for the Government still have diminished statutory protections. The Government must also ensure that Federal employees know their rights. Therefore, the Administration will:
- Mandate Participation in the Office of Special Counsel Whistleblower Certification Program. To ensure that Federal employees understand their whistleblower rights and how to make protected disclosures, the Administration will require covered agencies to complete the U.S. Office of Special Counsel’s program to certify compliance with the Whistleblower Protection Act’s notification requirements.
-Implement the Presidential Directive on Protecting Whistleblowers. The U.S. Government will continue to work to implement the President’s October 2012 Policy Directive on Protecting Whistleblowers with Access to Classified Information (PPD-19), including by ensuring strong, independent due process procedures; awareness of protections; and agency understanding of the protections available to government contractors under the directive.
- Advocate for Legislation to Expand Whistleblower Protections. With the Administration’s support, Congress recently enacted legislation to strengthen whistleblower protections for most Federal Government employees and contractors, but there are still gaps in statutory protections available to certain government employees and contractors. The Administration will continue to work with Congress to enact appropriate legislation to protect these individuals.

These legal entities are used to access the international financial system and facilitate financial crime, while masking the true identity of illicit actors. These legal entities are also used by individuals and companies to shelter assets and evade taxes. Enhanced transparency of companies formed in the United States will help to prevent criminal organizations from obscuring who really benefits from the businesses they operate, help to address tax avoidance, and also help developing countries to combat corruption when criminal actors look to illicitly deposit their money abroad. To promote transparency in company ownership, the Administration will:
-Advocate for Legislation Requiring Meaningful Disclosure. The White House will continue to publicly advocate for legislation requiring disclosure of meaningful information at the time a company is formed, showing not just who owns the company, but also who receives financial benefits from the entity.
-Establish an Explicit Customer Due Diligence Obligation for U.S. Financial Institutions. In 2014, the Administration will work to enact a rule requiring U.S. financial institutions to identify the beneficial owners of companies that are legal entities.

Building upon the successful implementation of open data commitments in the first NAP, the second NAP will include commitments to make government data more accessible and useful for the public. Through these commitments, the United States will:
-Manage Government Data as a Strategic Asset. In an effort to make U.S. Government data more accessible and useful, Federal agencies will develop an inventory of their data and publish a list of datasets that are public or can be made public. Agencies will also develop new mechanisms to solicit public feedback regarding open government data.
-Launch an Improved Data.gov. Data.gov allows the public to easily find, download, and use data collected or created by the Federal Government. The United States will launch a new version of Data.gov to make it even easier to discover, understand, and use open government data. The new Data.gov will index all Federal agency datasets in one easy-to-use catalog. This new website will help developers, researchers, journalists, and other stakeholders find data and will help the public more easily find tools and resources to access Government services.
-Open Agriculture and Nutrition Data. Global development, agriculture, and health have been a key focus of the Administration’s Open Data Initiatives. To expand these efforts internationally, the United States, in partnership with the United Kingdom, established the Global Open Data on Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN). GODAN aims to increase the quality, quantity, and timeliness of available data to support agriculture and nutrition efforts — as well as to increase the number and diversity of stakeholders who are applying data-based solutions to improve agriculture and nutrition. This initiative will support public and private global efforts to make agriculture and nutrition data more available and easier to access. The United States will create an interagency group that will promote open data efforts in the public and private sectors and encourage new efforts to release agriculture and nutrition data.

Recognizing the value of the American public as a strategic partner in addressing some of the country’s most pressing challenges, the United States will work to more effectively harness the expertise, ingenuity, and creativity of the American public by enabling, accelerating, and scaling the use of open innovation methods across the Federal Government, including commitments to:
-Create an Open Innovation Toolkit. In 2014, the Administration will convene an interagency group to develop an “open innovation toolkit” for Federal agencies that will include best practices, training, policies, and guidance on authorities related to open innovation, including approaches such as incentive prizes, crowdsourcing, and citizen science.
-New Incentive Prizes and Challenges on Challenge.gov. The U.S. Government champions the use of challenges, prizes, and competitions to catalyze breakthroughs in national priorities. Launched on September 2010, Challenge.gov has hosted more than 300 crowdsourcing competitions, and the platform has been used by more than 50 Federal departments and agencies. The website will continue to provide public listings of new competitions offered by the Administration to engage citizens in solving difficult problems to help agencies achieve their missions.
-Increased Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Programs. Public participation in scientific research, one type of crowdsourcing known as “citizen science”, allows the public to make critical contributions to the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math by collecting, analyzing, and sharing a wide range of data. The Administration will expand its use of crowdsourcing and citizen science programs to further engage the public in problem-solving. For example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will seek to drastically increase the number of asteroid observations by the amateur astronomer community as part of the Asteroid Grand Challenge. NASA will also launch the third International Space Apps Challenge in 2014, building upon the previously successful International Space Apps Challenges to continue to use publicly-released data to solve global challenges. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency will expand its citizen science activities, such as leveraging crowdsourcing to monitor water quality; NARA will increase its citizen archivist crowdsourcing projects that make records more accessible online to include captioning of historical films and transcription of other Federal records by the public; and the U.S. Geological Survey will expand its National Map Corps program to use public input to improve the National Map.",,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a growing body of evidence that the use of open education resources improves the quality of teaching and learning, including by accelerating student comprehension and by fostering more opportunities for affordable cross-border and cross-cultural educational experiences. The United States is committed to open education and will:
- Raise open education awareness and identify new partnerships. The U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Education, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy will jointly host a workshop on challenges and opportunities in open education internationally with stakeholders from academia, industry, and government. The session will foster collaboration among OGP members and other interested governments and will produce best practices to inform good policies in open education. 
- Pilot new models for using open educational resources to support learning. The State Department will conduct three pilots overseas by December 2015 that use open educational resources to support learning in formal and informal learning contexts. The pilots’ results, including best practices, will be made publicly available for interested educators. 
- Launch an online skills academy. The Department of Labor (DOL), with cooperation from the Department of Education, will award $25 million through competitive grants to launch an online skills academy in 2015 that will offer open online courses of study, using technology to create high-quality, free, or low-cost pathways to degrees, certificates, and other employer-recognized credentials. This academy will help students prepare for in-demand careers. Courses will be free for all to access on an open learning platform, although limited costs may be incurred for students seeking college credit that can be counted toward a degree. Leveraging emerging public and private models, the investments will help students earn credentials online through participating accredited institutions, and expand the open access to curriculum designed to speed the time to credit and completion. The online skills academy will also leverage the burgeoning marketplace of free and open-licensed learning resources, including content developed through DOL’s community college grant program, to ensure that workers can get the education and training they need to advance their careers, particularly in key areas of the economy.

In 2015, as part of implementation of the DATA Act, the Administration will work to improve the accessibility and reusability of Federal financial data by issuing data element definition standards and standards for exchanging financial data. The Administration, through the Office of Management and Budget, will leverage industry data exchange standards to the extent practicable to maximize the sharing and utilization of Federal financial data.
- Explore options for visualization and publication of additional Federal financial data. The Administration, through the Treasury Department, will use small-scale pilots to help explore options for visualizing and publishing Federal financial data from across the government as required by the DATA Act.
- Continue to engage stakeholders. The Administration will continue to engage with a broad group of stakeholders to seek input on Federal financial transparency initiatives including DATA Act implementation, by hosting town hall meetings, conducting interactive workshops, and seeking input via open innovation collaboration tools.",,,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Administration is taking action to ensure responsible uses of big data to promote greater openness and accountability across a range of areas and sectors. As part of the work it is doing in this area, the Administration has committed to:
- Enhance sharing of best practices on data privacy for state and local law enforcement. Federal agencies with expertise in law enforcement, privacy, and data practices will seek to enhance collaboration and information sharing about privacy best practices among state and local law enforcement agencies receiving Federal grants.
- Ensure privacy protection for big data analyses in health. Big Data introduces new opportunities to advance medicine and science, improve health care, and support better public health. To ensure that individual privacy is protected while capitalizing on new technologies and data, the Administration, led by the Department of Health and Human Services, will: (1) consult with stakeholders to assess how Federal laws and regulations can best accommodate big data analyses that promise to advance medical science and reduce health care costs; and (2) develop recommendations for ways to promote and facilitate research through access to data while safeguarding patient privacy and autonomy. These recommendations will inform potential legislative efforts, regulatory guidance, and policy actions.

power into citizens’ hands and make it easier for local people to contribute to the local decision making process and help shape public services.","In September 2011 the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) published
the Code of Recommended Practice for Local Authorities on Data Transparency. This Code
was issued to meet the government’s desire to place more power into citizens’ hands to
increase democratic accountability and make it easier for local people to contribute to the local decision making process and help shape public services. The government will issue a revised Code and is minded to bring into force regulations to make it a legal requirement for local authorities to publish data in accordance with parts of the revised Code.
Local authorities have responded positively to this agenda – all local authorities are already publishing expenditure of £500 and over, but performance on publishing other data varies across authorities; the NAO found that only 4% of local authorities published information on land and building assets. The revised Code will ensure greater consistency in the data that is made available to local people across England.
Timescales: The next steps to deliver this policy are to:
-publish the government response to its consultation on revising the Code, including a draft
of the revised Code (November 2013)
-issue the revised Local Authorities Data Transparency Code (Winter 2013)
-bring into force regulations making it a legal requirement for local authorities to publish data

By 2015, the UK aims to be the most transparent social investment market in the Open Government Partnership and G20, in line with the Open Data Charter principles.","Social investment blends financial return and social impact. Both investors and the end ventures they support need clarity on the financial and social return they are achieving. Actions to increase this clarity will lead to greater transparency (across metrics of impact), accountability (as more citizens can see the effectiveness of public services) and participation (as more ventures can access public service contracts, and more citizens invest their money for social impact). As of 2013, Cabinet Office has:
- set up, under the UK’s Presidency of the G8, the first Social Impact Investment Taskforce, with the aim of bringing greater consistency across the international field
- supported Inspiring Impact; this programme, coordinated by New Philanthropy Capital, aims to make high quality impact measurement the norm for charities and social enterprises by 2022 – the first year of the programme developed a Code of Good Impact Practice
- worked collaboratively with partners in the sector to create the UK’s first Social Investment Readiness Charter, setting out five principles through which to support the market linked with leading sector organisations to establish the Market Stewardship Research Group, which delivers an ongoing and publicly available research agenda

,2,UK,"5. The UK government will manage and capture digital records and there will be a comprehensive, accessible and timely paper and digital record of UK government available to the citizen.","Ensuring the creation, capture and survival of essential public records is the ultimate guarantee of transparency for governments. Without good information management, there is no transparency; no records for public scrutiny and use or to provide necessary evidence to underpin data and statistics to benefit the wider public sector and the citizen.
The UK government needs to define clearly what records departments need to keep in the digital era, both in paper and digital format, and to enable them to do this efficiently and effectively. This will help to ensure that information is available and survives for scrutiny both now and in the future.
The UK government is working with archives across the public sector to help ensure that this potential is realised at both local and national levels.
On 1 January 2013, the period by which records selected for permanent preservation should be transferred to The National Archives and specialist places of deposit was reduced from 30 to 20 years. The change to a ‘20 year rule’ is being implemented over a ten-year transition period that will enable departments to transfer two years worth of records to The National Archives every year until 2023. This is estimated to have effected over three million government records. This is a key part of the UK’s transparency agenda and will see a wealth of historical material opened up to the public much earlier. The aim is to provide greater openness and accountability,
strengthening democracy through more timely public scrutiny of government policy and
decision-making.

Key achievements up to 2013 are:
- The National Archives worked with departments to examine existing processes and identify efficiencies. The work delivered an efficient, scalable and sustainable transfer process for paper records, which form the majority of records covered by the transition period, which delivered real cost savings to government
- during 2012, The National Archives also revised and updated its records collection policy. This defines the types of records that should be taken into its collection and that departments should identify for permanent preservation
- the Information Principles for the UK public sector were released in December 2011 under
the government’s ICT Strategy, which referenced many areas of guidance and best practice
supported by The National Archives
The National Archives has been preserving government websites for a decade. The UK Government Web Archive includes material that dates from 1996 to the present. It ensures that, through preservation and web continuity, links persist and government information published online remains fully accessible online. It also captures the websites of major public inquiries.
Timescales
The key milestones for the delivery of this commitment are:
- by April 2014, The National Archives will deliver a fully operational mechanism for the accessioning and preservation of digital records – the Digital Records Infrastructure (DRI)
- by April 2015, The National Archives will have an efficient, scalable and sustainable process for the transfer of digital records to the DRI supported by publicly available guidance on its website and training for transferring departments
- by 2023, the transition to the 20 year rule will be complete; departmental compliance in transferring records to The National Archives under the Public Records Act is measured inits bi-annual Records Transfer Report, which details statistics on the status of departments’ progress",The National Archives,CSOs: The International Records Management Trust,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2,UK,"6. The UK government will, for the first time, bring together all of the UK’s anti-corruption efforts under one cross-government anti-corruption plan.","The UK’s work so far has sought to address corruption both at home and abroad. The UK government takes the issue of preventing and dealing with corruption where it occurs - both at home and overseas – very seriously. Over recent years, the UK has taken a number of steps to deal with corruption and we have good structures and legislation already in place including:
- the Bribery Act (2010) which is a world-leading piece of legislation reforming criminal law to provide a new, modern and comprehensive scheme of bribery offences and including a new offence of failure by a commercial organisation to prevent a bribe being paid for or on its behalf
- the introduction of Deferred Prosecution Agreements as an additional tool to help prosecutors deal with bribery and corruption in large companies
- the appointment of a government Anti-Corruption Champion covering both domestic and international affairs
- two Department for International Development (DFID)-funded police units, one in the Metropolitan Police investigating money stolen from developing countries and laundered through the UK, and another unit in the City of London Police tackling bribery by UK companies and nationals in developing countries
- steps taken to tackle abuse of the LIBOR mechanism
- creation of the National Crime Agency which has the role and remit to lead, support and direct other agencies to tackle serious and organised fraud, bribery and corruption
- publication of the new Serious and Organised Crime Strategy, which sets out how we will
make the UK a more hostile place for bribery and corruption; the strategy makes it clear that the Home Office will take a new lead role in coordinating all domestic bribery and corruption policy, working with the Cabinet Office and DFID to align this with work on corruption overseas
- the creation in 2012 of a UK Asset Recovery Task Force to gather evidence, trace assets
and pursue legal cases to return money stolen and laundered through the UK by the former
regimes of the Arab Spring countries
Even with this activity taking place, we recognise that there is more that can be done to improve our standing at home and to better manage our reputation for dealing with corruption and bribery offences overseas. To do this, the UK government will for the first time bring together all of the UK’s anti-corruption efforts under one cross-government anti-corruption plan. The plan will bring greater coordination and effectiveness to the UK’s efforts to tackle corruption both domestically and internationally, across government and its agencies, and with civil society, business and international institutions. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and civil society organisations (CSOs) will be consulted for their views on the content of the plan.
The plan will include a range of measures that the UK will take to prevent corruption and
enforce relevant legislation. For example, once refreshed EU rules are in place – whereby we are already required to exclude suppliers for bribery and corruption – we will reconsider:
- the potential benefits and disadvantages of a register of excluded suppliers
- implementing and enforcing the UK Bribery Act by resourcing enforcement agencies and
ensuring effective reporting processes
- tackling money laundering through international collaboration
The UK government will also build on good progress made so far, by continuing to work with the UK’s Overseas Territories to extend to them the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Anti-Bribery Convention. The Home Office will provide the coordination function across government which will report jointly to the Home Secretary and the government’s Anti Corruption Champion.

,2,UK,7. The UK government will lead by example by creating a publicly accessible central registry of company beneficial ownership information. The registry will contain information about who ultimately owns and controls UK companies.,"A lack of knowledge about who ultimately controls, owns and profits from companies and legal arrangements facilitates their misuse for illicit purposes including tax evasion, money laundering, corruption and bribery.
The UK is committed to lead by example to implement international standards on transparency of ownership and control to tackle the misuse of companies and legal arrangements. In particular, the UK has committed to place a requirement on companies to obtain and hold adequate, accurate and current information on their beneficial ownership – defined as the natural person(s) who ultimately owns or controls a legal person or arrangement.
Company beneficial ownership information will be held in a central registry maintained by
Companies House. The UK sought views on whether information in the registry should be made
publicly accessible. A large number of respondents to the consultation supported this in the interests of promoting positive corporate behaviour and transparency, though concerns were also expressed, notably around competitiveness impacts and privacy. Having carefully
considered the arguments for and against, the UK has committed to making information on
individuals with significant interests in UK companies accessible publicly via Companies House, potentially using as a model the type of information already in the public domain on company shareholders.
As we further develop the policy we will give careful consideration to:
- how we can best protect individuals who might be at risk of harm through disclosure of this
information
- the sanctions that will apply if individuals or companies deliberately provide false
information, or fail to provide information
- how the registry will operate in practice
This will help ensure the robust implementation of the new requirements.
In parallel, the UK is taking forward related G8 commitments to enhance corporate transparency and has sought views on the following issues:
- the prohibition of new and existing bearer shares, which allow company shares to be traded anonymously
- enhanced transparency around the use of nominee directors, which can be used to conceal who really controls a company
- the prohibition of corporate directors, which can be used to create an opaque corporate structure
Furthermore, we continue to pursue the same level of ambition through the EU, G8 and the
G20. All G8 countries have published action plans on beneficial ownership. The G20 also
declared at St Petersburg this year that they too will lead by example on implementation of beneficial ownership requirements, and G20 leaders have tasked finance ministers to update the G20 next year on steps taken to meet the relevant international standards. In the EU, the UK is continuing to push for an ambitious approach in the context of proposals for a Fourth EU Money Laundering Directive.
Through the UK’s G8 action plan on beneficial ownership, the UK is taking forward a number of other commitments. We are currently undertaking the UK’s first ever national risk assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing threat to be completed in 2014. We also committed to improve the supervision and enforcement of those that facilitate company formation in the UK. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) are currently leading a review of supervision and enforcement of trust and service providers which will include consideration of additional measures to ensure company formation agents conduct effective due diligence including the identification and verification of beneficial owners. We will also take forward work in the context of the national risk assessment to assess the money laundering and terrorist financing risk posed by trusts, and through the Fourth EU Money Laundering Directive we will seek to ensure that trustees of express trusts are obliged to obtain and hold adequate, accurate and current information on beneficial ownership regarding the trust. Furthermore, we are working hard in the OECD to establish a new global standard on automatic exchange of information which the G20 has called for by February 2014. This will provide greater transparency over trusts than ever before, providing the authorities with more information to tackle the misuse of trusts.
Timescales: The government discussion paper relating to these commitments has informed this action plan. Implementation will now be taken forward through amendments to company law, led by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and through: transposition of the Fourth EU Money Laundering Directive, which is currently being negotiated; amendments to the UK Money Laundering Regulations; and other relevant bilateral and multilateral agreements led by HM Treasury.","Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, HM Treasury","CSOs: CAFOD, Christian Aid, Global Witness, ONE, Open Knowledge Foundation, OpenCorporates, Oxfam, Save the Children, Tearfund, Transparency International UK",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It would still be possible for police bodies to retain records such as scene of crime evidence for a further period if they could demonstrate the records were needed for current and future work. The working group will determine the potential benefits and whether it recommends to ministers implementation of the recommendation made by the Hillsborough Independent Panel.

- using its bilateral and multilateral relationships to encourage the establishment of at least four new national CoST programmes in countries where DFID is working","Promoting transparency and accountability in infrastructure will achieve impact in four interrelated areas:
- reductions in corruption, mismanagement and inefficiency
- creating a business environment in which contracts are awarded solely on the basis of price and quality
- better value for money invested in infrastructure
- better quality infrastructure and services
The beneficiaries of these improvements are all those who contribute to the public purse through taxation and/or use public infrastructure. Private sector organisations that follow principles of integrity and efficient management in bidding for and undertaking construction work will also benefit.
Our vision is for all governments to be applying the principles of openness and accountability to government funded construction projects. Realising this vision is an enormous task and requires action on many fronts, but the commitments included here will help demonstrate how it can be achieved.
Timescales: The key milestones for this commitment are:

To make the entire collection of UK legislation available free of charge on a user friendly platform such as legislation.gov.uk enables lawyers and ordinary citizens alike to identify and scrutinise the laws on which their legal rights and responsibilities are based. The site contains legislation as it is originally enacted or made, and in the case of Acts in revised or amended form, thereby showing changes to legislation over time. It already offers users significant access to UK legislation. Legislation.gov.uk is the world’s first linked data statute book, providing free online access to all UK legislation. Bringing the online statute book fully up to date will provide full access to the statute book as open data – providing an API to give developers full and open access to the underlying data – and will be a step change in transparency and access to the law.

The UK government is committed to ensuring a strong legislative framework to encourage workers to speak up about wrongdoing, risk or malpractice without fear of reprisal.","The government’s vision is to ensure that whistleblowers are protected from suffering any reprisal. Whistleblowing is recognised as playing an important role in preventing malpractice
and illegal activity and it is right that individuals are protected when acting to expose wrongdoing that is in the public interest. Where there are barriers to whistleblowing, such as the fear of losing employment or being bullied, it creates a negative culture that prevents wrongdoing from being effectively addressed. Recent case studies have indicated that the legislation has not worked as effectively as hoped and it has also shown that there is a need for a cultural shift in attitude to whistleblowing.
The UK government is working to ensure that issues with the existing framework to protect whistleblowers are resolved, so that government can contribute to achieving the cultural change
necessary. This work was initiated through changes made in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 and continues in the current call for evidence on the legislative framework. The UK government will consider using a range of complimentary measures to achieve its vision. The appropriate mechanisms will be used for implementation. This could be anything from legislative change, statutory or non statutory codes of practice, guidance or best practice measures.
Timescales: The changes that have already been introduced will be reviewed as part of the wider evaluation strategy for the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013. This is a five year plan and will draw conclusions by 2018. The call for evidence will close on 1 November 2013.

We will build on the existing foundation of transparency in procurement and contracting and, in consultation with civil society organisations and other stakeholders, we will look at ways to enhance the scope, breadth and usability of published contractual data.","‘Open contracting’ refers to practices for increased disclosure and citizen participation in public contracting. It covers the entire process, including formation, award, execution, performance
and completion of public contracts. Domestically, our vision is to provide accountability to the taxpayer for how government funds are spent, to drive better value for money and increased competition, and to improve the quality of the services and products government buys. We will achieve this by delivering greater transparency of the procurement and contracting process.
The UK is sharing its expertise in open contracting through an international group of organisations led by the World Bank. The Open Contracting Partnership introduced a set of Open Contracting Global Principles to a public audience for consultation on its blog and website in August 2013. This was after developing them over a period of 18 months with over 200 representatives from governments, the private sector and civil society. The UK broadly welcomes these principles and will look to assist developing nations to improve the transparency of their government contracting. The Open Contracting Partnership is also working to develop a set of open data standards that should also deliver greater harmonisation of the data that is published.
Timescales: Over the next 12 to 24 months the UK government will:
- endorse, implement and champion internationally the Open Contracting Principles at the end of October 2013 and continue to assist in the development of a set of open contracting data standards
- subject to technical capability, enhance the scope, breadth and usability of published contractual data on the Contracts Finder system to include:
o providing greater transparency of contracts awarded overseas, beginning October 2013
o delivering a new procurement pipeline in November 2013
o investigating the feasibility of providing greater transparency of design competitions run by the Technology Strategy Board
o engaging with prime contractors to encourage them to provide improved visibility of
supply chain opportunities, and explore a means of standardising the publication of
sub-contractor details through Contracts Finder to make this data more accessible
o investigating the use of open corporate identifiers to allow the data to be more easily
compared and linked to other data held about contracting authorities and suppliers;
o working with a user group to look at ways of improving site usability to make it easier
to publish data and to find opportunities and other data of interest

The Scottish government broadly endorses the principles of ‘open contracting’ and commits to work with civil society and wider stakeholder groups to improve transparency in its procurement practices as part of our continuing programme of procurement reform.,"The Scottish government has set out a clear vision for the future of Scotland. At the core of its programme is the determination to focus government and public services on creating a more successful country, with opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish, through increasing sustainable economic growth. The Scottish government and the wider public sector are committed to public procurement reform. The Procurement Reform (Scotland) Bill is intended to build on the work to date. It aims to establish a national legislative framework for public procurement that supports Scotland’s economic growth by delivering social and environmental benefits, supporting innovation and promoting public procurement processes and systems which are transparent, streamlined, standardised, proportionate, fair and business friendly.
Promoting transparency, accountability and the efficient use of public resources is central to this vision and to ensuring value for money. ‘Open contracting’ relates to ensuring transparency and accountability in procurement practices and procedures, which in turn will promote fair competition and greater access by all sectors to public sector contracts.
Timescales: In 2014, the Scottish government will undertake external stakeholder engagement on the ‘open contracting’ commitment. We will, monitor the extents to which contracts are advertised through PCS and compliance generally with the transparency elements of the Bill and our widerprocurement reform programme.",Scottish government,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2,UK,"14. The UK government will show leadership in transforming the transparency of global development assistance by publishing information on official development assistance (ODA) in line with the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) Standard, so that UK assistance can be tracked through the delivery chain.","Increasing the transparency and traceability of development spending has the potential to transform the way aid is delivered globally and to improve its impact. Making information about aid spending easier to access, understand and use means that taxpayers in donor countries and citizens in developing countries can more easily hold governments to account for using funds wisely. It also enables international development actors to coordinate and plan their activities more effectively. As the UK achieves the milestone of providing 0.7% of Gross National Income on development assistance from 2013, this greater transparency and openness is a crucial element of helping to ensure we get best value for every pound spent.
Achievement of this commitment will result in more UK data on development assistance being published and available in a common format to an internationally recognised standard. We will also encourage other providers of development assistance to make their information available in this common format, helping to create a richer global dataset of more open, timely, comprehensive, comparable and reusable information.
Timescales: The Cabinet Office and DFID will work together to ensure that UK government departments that spend ODA publish information in line with IATI by 2015. In addition, DFID will:
-implement the Busan Common Standard on Aid Transparency, including both the Creditor
Reporting System of the OECD Development Assistance Committee and IATI by 2015; this
means making data available according to the internationally recognised standard in a
format that is open, comprehensive, comparable and re-usable
-improve the accessibility of development assistance information by launching the UK ‘Development Tracker’ by the end of 2013 – this will increase the level of detail of information available on DFID projects and expenditure, readable by use of a browser as well as providing data in open data files; we will also publish summary information in major local languages in a way that is accessible to citizens in the countries in which we work
-work with international donors and partner countries to better link development assistance data with partner countries’ budget data, through the development of the IATI budget identifier, by June 2014; this will make it easier to understand and trace how development assistance is being spent in partner countries
-introduce approaches to improving the traceability of UK development assistance through a range of delivery chains by August 2014; this includes pilots with a number of private sector suppliers and CSOs by March 2014 and a requirement of IATI publication by the end of 2015 for all implementing partners

,2,UK,15. NHS England will be improving the quality and breadth of information available to citizens to support them to participate more fully in both their own health care and in the quality and design of health services which will result in greater accountability of NHS England.,"The English healthcare system is already one of the most transparent in the world – publishing more information than any other country. It is now taking further steps to transform access to data for patients, doctors, researchers, and academics. This ambition is central to NHS England’s strategy of delivering high quality care for all by improving the quality, efficiency and equity of health services. Greater transparency will empower patients and citizens to hold the health service to account and at the same time support life sciences research so that more life saving treatments can be found. 
The key milestones for this commitment are:
-overarching clinical indicators – for ten new clinical areas (including cancer, children’s services, mental health and stroke), data will be made available to tell the public how well services are performing and meeting their needs; the first of these will be available by Summer 2014 with more available over the following 12 months. Once it is available, we will be able to use the care.data information service outlined above to support the development of this information
-more clinician level data – building on the successful publication of surgeon level data from national clinical audits across ten specialties earlier this year, NHS England will extend the programme to new treatments and conditions (throughout 2014)
-General Practice information – new information about the quality of care provided by GP practice and associated health outcomes will be made available both as open data and also through public facing channels such as NHS Choices (Winter 2013)
-social care transparency – information about care services for around 10,000 care homes collected by the NHS Choices website will be made available as open data in the Summer of 2014
-extending the Friends and Family test – the successful Friends and Family Test programme that asks patients whether they would recommend the hospital services they used to friends or family members will be extended to cover GP practices, community and mental health services in December 2014 and all other NHS services by the end of March 2015
-patients in control – newly developed Patient Centred Outcome Measurement (PCOM) tools will provide new insights into how well services for people with 20 different rare and complex conditions are meeting the needs of their patients. These measures will expand the evidence base for the effectiveness of treatments, therapies and interventions and help improve the quality of patient care. In developing the PCOM tools, NHS England will support on-line communities that will both help to develop the tools, and provide mutually beneficial help, advice and support to one another
-better open data – to help people to locate and use data about health more easily NHS England, with the Health and Social Care Information Centre, will comprehensively review the way that data is made available through data.gov.uk. This will ensure that health information is easy to find and tagged. We will also increase the availability and accessibility of key reference data which is available as open data including geographical information (Summer 2014)
-by June 2014, clinical data from GP practices will be linked to data from all hospitals providing NHS funded care through the care.data initiative outlined above. This will allow us to develop and publish new insights into the quality of services and to better understand the way that services interact, an issue that we know is important for patients 
We have an ambitious programme of work to support patients to take greater control of their own health and wellbeing. This will be supported by their General Practice which will offer a range of digital services. Our ambition is that by March 2015 everyone who wishes to will be able to:
-order repeat prescriptions and book appointments online
-view their own GP record, including test results, online
-have secure electronic communication with their practice

,2,UK,16. The UK government will demonstrate the potential of open policy making by running at least five ‘test and demonstrate projects’ across different policy areas. These will inform how open policy making can be deployed across the civil service.,"The UK government’s commitment to open policy making was set out in the Civil Service Reform Plan. However, open policy making cannot be introduced by management order – it is an attitude more than a set of processes. To convince officials that open policy making is worthwhile, and to convince the public and others that the government is willing to follow through on its commitment, there is a need to demonstrate how open policy making can really work.
These demonstrators need to make clear that open policy making is not dependent on deep technical knowledge, and is not futuristic – the key message should be “people like you are doing open policy making right now”. A range of different projects – expressly set up as experiments – will show officials at national and local level how open policy making can be integrated into the everyday business of government.
The projects will cut across different policy areas and demonstrate how different open approaches can be used to improve policy. These approaches will include:
-sharing the context and evidence on which policy development is being based, both at the start and throughout the policy process
-engaging a broad range of experts – both from a professional and an experiential point of view – in the development of policy and ensuring their views are effectively gathered and demonstrably part of the result
-using new platforms to break open traditional consultation approaches to enable citizens to comment and track how policy is developing
Timescales: A meeting during the Autumn will identify candidate projects, with each requiring approval from their department and ministerial structures before they can formally be included. A final list will be agreed by January 2014. The development and learning from the projects will be shared via existing open policy making networks throughout the process. Those outside of government will be actively encouraged to comment on, and contribute to, progress. In early 2015, after the completion of the projects, the government will set out how it will embed the learning and successful approaches uncovered across the civil service policy profession.

The UK government will publish legislation in a draft format on GOV.UK whenever appropriate, in order to enable and promote public involvement and engagement in proposed changes to the law.","The UK government has a good track record of publishing legislation in draft and consulting on it before it is introduced. Experience to date suggests that the process of consultation, and of formal pre-legislative scrutiny by parliamentary committees, has potential to improve the quality of legislation by engaging stakeholders and the wider public at an early stage, giving an opportunity for legislation to reflect the input of those potentially affected by it. Making this practice the norm will, given the experience to date, help further the transparency of law and the policy development process, and improve understanding and engagement with legislation. Government is committed to following Principle 2.4 of the Compact which states, “Give early notice of forthcoming consultations, where possible, allowing enough time for civil society organisations to involve their service users, beneficiaries, members, volunteers and trustees in preparing responses. Where it is appropriate, and enables meaningful engagement, conduct 12-week formal written consultations, with clear explanations and a rationale for shorter timeframes or a more informal approach.”
Timescales: The procedure and timescales for publishing bills in draft is set by the Cabinet Office’s Parliamentary Business and Legislation Secretariat and Parliament. At an early stage in the process of approving work on new legislation, the government will set out its commitment to publish a bill in draft on GOV.UK (or the reasons why publication is not appropriate in a particular case). The effect of publication will be evaluated on a case by case basis. This will take into account levels of stakeholder engagement in policy development.

The UK government will ensure the OpenDataCommunities programme continues to free up DCLG’s evidence-base from literally thousands of disconnected spreadsheets, so that it can be quickly and easily discovered, combined and re-used over the web alongside related third party sources.","DCLG will continue to extend the range and volume of fully accessible, five-star data published via its OpenDataCommunities service. It will also maintain a showcase of visualisations and interactive dashboards to demonstrate how developers, data analysts and local communities can use the open datasets to better understand the interplay of economic and social factors on specific neighbourhoods across the UK. Standards and best practice developed under the programme will also be promoted domestically (particularly amongst local authorities) and internationally. The vision is that by 2015, OpenDataCommunities will be the DCLG’s single platform for:
-routinely releasing all departmental data sources in a fully open, accessible and re usable forms, whilst preserving data quality and integrity
-stimulating third parties to use departmental data alongside related external sources to deliver innovative new tools and insights
-supporting the department to use its own and related third party sources in a more efficient, cost-effective manner, when designing and implementing policies and programmes
-building and spreading best practice for sharing and re-using data based on common standards, with a particular focus on partnerships with local authorities and other local public sector agents to unlock and publish their local sources in a consistent, comparable form
The benefits and impact will include:
-enabling economic growth – open and accessible data will enable growth of new services in the information economy, plus delivery of more efficient/cost-effective data sharing within current ‘data rich’ business networks, eg by streamlining sharing of data amongst business engaged in land-use planning and house-building
-facilitating social growth – open data drawn from multiple sources will be the fuel to power greater public participation in and understanding of DCLG’s policies and programmes at the local level. This is particularly important for policies under the localism and Community Rights agendas including Neighbourhood Planning and Neighbourhood Budgeting
-greater efficiency and cost-savings for DCLG and its partners – through standardising data and making it more open and accessible, we will reduce the cost and overheads of sharing often incompatible sources amongst a broad and diverse partner network. When coupled with development of new digital tools and services, this will deliver knock-on benefits to citizens, local communities, and businesses (ie data users), eg by providing outputs that are easier to understand and use, thereby streamlining the process, and so reducing the costs and overheads of engaging with public service providers
OpenDataCommunities is still largely in its formative stage, and driven by user demand for data, so it is difficult to provide precise milestones. However, in broad terms, the key outputs to be delivered by the end of 2015 will be:
-a robust, reliable and trusted source of DCLG data in fully open, accessible forms – with data content delivered according to user demand and priorities established under the NII
and supporting strategies
-active, sustained and significant use of sources in OpenDataCommunities by local authorities, public sector agencies, voluntary and charity organisations, and the private sector. To be achieved through pro-active, targeted promotion and communications, working closely with users to capture and disseminate evidence of benefits achieved
-strong and effective partnerships with key national and local bodies, thereby maximising reuse of OpenDataCommunities’ standards and best practices
-alignment of OpenDataCommunities with data.gov.uk, and new data visualisation and collaboration tools emerging on the single government domain – thereby maximisingopportunities for DCLG content to be combined with and re-used alongside related public sector sources

governments’ disclosure of the revenues received from each company and for each project, will help make the extractive industries far more transparent and accountable worldwide. Our vision is that by 2020 at the latest all the world’s extractive companies will be required by home country regulations and stock market listing rules, and by host country membership of the EITI, to report their payments to governments by country and by project for every country where they do business and, where applicable, to hold information on their beneficial ownership and consider making it publicly available.

in ensuring that internet connectivity,
access, hardware and content is an imminent requirement to bridging the digital divide, and streamlining learning in the country.
The Department has embarked on a schools connectivity rollout project with telecoms operators as a start to ensure that we bring technology to learners. This will be done in
2 phases, whereby phase 1 will entail the connectivity to 1650 schools by savings achieved in the 2010 World Cup, and phase 2 will be rolled out by telecoms operators under their Universal Service Obligations (USO).
Phase 1
Financial savings has been achieved in the
2010 World Cup by Telkom. The Department
has requested that Telkom provide a model whereby schools will be connected with the financial savings derived. As such, the initial plan was to provide only internet connectivity to schools; however the department realised that a turnkey solution would benefit the schools and learners better than just internet connectivity. Department of Basic Education (DBE) then derived a hardware specification for the model which is to be implemented.
This then would ensure that schools would receive internet connectivity and hardware (computers) in the 1650 schools identified. Further to this, DBE will be developing an internet portal for education, thus allowing learners and teachers to access educational content.
Any solution is never complete without ICT training, hence, the department intends to provide free ICT training to teachers, thus empowering them to be able to use the technology provided and also pass on this knowledge to learners. This rollout is intended to start in the current financial year, and will span for 2years thereafter.
Phase 2
In order for telecoms operators to be given a license, community obligations regarded as Universal Service Obligations (USO) were imposed on them to fulfil. One such obligation is providing connectivity to schools. Each operator was allocated a number of schools to connect which ICASA had to allocate and manage.
Providing connectivity without hardware (computers) is futile, hence ICASA will be in the process of amending certain obligations to include a full solution to each school that an operator connects. Once this process is completed, the operators will provide a rollout plan which will be managed by ICASA, and monitored by the Department of Communications & Department of Basic Education.",Department of Communications,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

one searchable database. Users can search this database to locate case documents 
relevant to their field of interest. Having located relevant case documents, users may 
submit requests to view these. Requests are sent to the respective agencies responsible 
for the case documents and public record entries. The agencies themselves then 
process requests sent to them via OEP, and reply to users directly.

on free software, and is therefore available to other levels of governments as well as

","Challenges and strategies for registering and preserving digital documentation 
produced by public bodies are outlined in the white paper on archiving (Meld. St. 7 
(2012-2013)). The basis for public access to such information consists partly of the 
public bodies’ systems and routines for registering and preserving digital documents. 
The most important measures involve developing joint solutions, standards and rules 
for handling of digital documents. In addition, the Norwegian archive authorities 
contribute to the development of cooperation on following up these challenges, both 
internationally and between Norwegian administrative levels.
Automated and specialized case management systems used by public bodies will 
include archive functions that link to documents and associated metadata, and store 
these in accordance with approved standards. These functions will ensure 
preservation of digital documentation in the short and long term as well as 
transparency and freedom of information.
Consideration will also be given to establishing joint solutions for preserving and 
making available digital documentation as soon as it is no longer in active 
administrative use. This will ensure both continued transparency and public

operates in, rather than a single set of information at a global level. Reporting, for 
example, taxes, royalties and bonuses that a multinational company pays to a host

Objetivo principal: Contribuir a la equidad y democracia ambiental en el marco del proceso internacional regional, que bajo el liderazgo de Chile, busca la construcción de un instrumento de cooperación para Latino América y el Caribe respecto a los derechos de acceso.
A nivel internacional la importancia del acceso a la información, la participación ciudadana y la justicia en temas ambientales se consagró en la Cumbre de la Tierra con la adopción del Principio 10 que reconoce que dichos derechos de acceso son la mejor manera de lidiar con los desafíos ambientales. Tomando en cuenta los avances en Latinoamérica y el Caribe así como los desafíos pendientes, Chile, trabajando de cerca con organizaciones de la sociedad civil, propuso una declaración regional en la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible (Río+20, Brasil junio 2012).
En lo principal, la declaración señala que “Es necesario alcanzar compromisos para la implementación cabal de los derechos de acceso a la información, participación y justicia ambientales, consagrados en el principio 10 de la Declaración de Río de 1992. Por ello, manifestamos nuestra voluntad de iniciar un proceso que explore la viabilidad de contar con un instrumento regional que puede ir desde guías, talleres y buenas prácticas hasta un convenio regional abierto a todos los países de la región y con la significativa participación de toda la ciudadanía interesada.

de Transparencia y Gobierno Electrónico para el año 2014 y son parte del análisis minucioso de factores
específicos en los cuales el Estado:

Requiere sistematizar procesos que son susceptibles de corrupción en la intervención por parte de
servidores públicos que interactúan con la ciudadanía.
Requiere agilizar procesos que tradicionalmente son tardados por la burocracia que genera el
manejo de la información.
Requiere que cada Institución del Organismo Ejecutivo determine, según el Decreto del Congreso
de la República 114-97 (Ley del Organismo Ejecutivo) cuales son las funciones principales y en base
a esas funciones se verifique cuáles de las funciones aún no han sido sistematizadas y puestas a
disposición de la mayor cantidad de ciudadanos.
Requiere minimizar los costos directos e indirectos para cada ciudadano en la realización de los
trámites que realiza.
Requiere apertura de datos en la rendición de cuentas.

        compendio de servicios        en línea del Estado de Guatemala, denominado UNIPORTAL®.  Este
        UNIPORTAL es un sistema que permitirá hacer búsquedas de todos los servicios públicos en línea

This will lead to increased transparency of the impact of public funds use for research purposes and increased collective intelligence of the academic research community.

,2,Romania,INCREASING THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF PUBLISHED OPEN DATA,"In October 2013, the national gateway data.gov.ro was launched ahead of the planned 2014 deadline. The platform represents the central access point for open data collected from the public administration.
The Chancellery of the Prime-Minister will intensify its efforts to promote the importance of open data publishing, particularly within public administration.
This step is considered an essential factor in increasing the quantity of datasets published on the data.gov.ro portal and the number of institutions involved in the process.
Along with the increase in quantity, the public institutions should also focus on enhancing the quality of the datasets they deliver, aiming for better structure and machine-readable formats.
The improvements in the quality and number of published open datasets will be correlated with the actions promoting the open data concept and the innovative use of datasets, as stated in commitment 4.

As there is a relative low understanding of the utility and necessity of opening public data, it is essential that the public servants already in charge with this process are trained accordingly. Subsequently, the trainees will be able to disseminate the acquired knowledge and best practices within their ministry.

Enhancing the openness of preparatory processes,"In the year 1 of the Action Plan the ownership of the already existing government’s project register and possibilities of its further development will be clarified. In addition, possibilities for further development of the state government’s project register are studied, including its usability and possibilities to increase the awareness of its existence.
To increase transparency government decision making processes are made more traceable by publishing clear and popular process maps and annual cycles of the core preparatory and decision-making processes during the years 1 and 2 of the Action Plan.
In year 1 the principles of the consultation guidelines of legislative work will be extended to the rest of the preparatory work in the state administration. Publishing drafts and alterna- tive solutions at the preparatory phase, using diverse consultation methods and consulting people of all ages will be emphasized when updating the guidelines.
In 2005 the Permanent State Secretaries signed common principles to enhance openness and consultation. In year 1 they will renew their commitment as their ministry’s “openness leaders” to further develop openness in their ministries and in the whole-of-government.
The marketing and implementation of the different functionalities of the e- participation environment/portal will be supported both in the state and municipal administration in year 1. Voluntary commitments will be collected from state agencies and municipalities on how they will promote openness. On their websites, the agencies will inform the public about their new actions to promote openness.

The Government of Ghana will substantially strengthen the human rights and anti- corruption regime already in existence by supporting the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) to more effectively pursue its human rights and anti-corruption mandates. One sure way of realizing this commitment will be to clarify the mandate of CHRAJ, in order to ensure that the Commission is not flooded with petitions outside its mandate, especially in Ghana’s rural districts.
Government will also support CHRAJ to monitor Government’s international human rights obligations. Currently, decisions of CHRAJ do not carry the weight of a court of justice. Government commits to introduce the necessary legislative instrument that will allow successful petitioners at CHRAJ to register CHRAJ decisions in court to constitute a judgment of a competent court of law.
Additionally, Government will review the salaries and conditions of service of CHRAJ personnel with a view to effecting a significant upgrade, to stem the tide of outflow of legal professionals from the Commission. Actions:
• Conduct a joint Government and relevant anti-corruption and human rights CSOs review of principal impediments to CHRAJ effectiveness
• Present report to Cabinet, through the Attorney-General, for consideration and implementation of recommendations
• Monitor impact of implementation of recommendations by joint Government-CSO committee.

The perennial challenge facing Government is one of finding a mechanism for exercising close oversight and comprehensive tracking of its various investments. Under the OGen government Initiative, the Government commits to assign open and transparent tracking of its overall investment as an additional responsibility of the Policy Evaluation and Oversight Unit in the Office of the President (PEOU). The PEOU, currently, has oversight responsibility for the performance of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) but lacks legislative backing. Actions:
• Political leadership and administrative heads to provide the PEOU with accurate and timely information.
• Organize a forum or meeting of CSOs in governance and economic policy to discuss legislative backing and additional PEOU responsibility for oversight and tracking of government investment
• Hold meeting with Attorney-General’s Department to prepare the draft legislation for the PEOU, including new function of exercising oversight and tracking of government investments.
During the OGPI plan period, Government will take steps to initiate the process for the PEOU legislative backing that clearly specifies the additional function of tracking overall government investment.

,1,Ghana,3.2.1 Participating In Local Government,"To bring government closer to the people and the people closer to their government, Ghana’s 1992 Fourth Republic Constitution provides for an elaborate system of decentralized government comprising three major structures, the Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assembly (MMDA). MMDAs advance the central government strategic goal of promoting local, economic and social development and democracy. Political parties are constitutionally barred from participation in elections to the decentralized local government bodies – MMDAs.
However, 70 percent of assembly members are elected and 30 percent appointed by the Central Government with advice from local stakeholders, especially Chiefs and other traditional rulers, with consideration for equitable gender representation. Each MMDA has another lower level elective structure, the Unit committee, area and town councils which are deeply embedded in local communities.
In addition to these representative structures, Government commits to deepening participatory democracy by encouraging MMDAs to promote extensive participation of local Civil Society Organizations in their budgetary processes and development planning. The National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP) shall, accordingly, require of MMDAs evidence of popular participation in these processes before acceptance and approval.
Government further commits to support Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs) to organize annual meet-the-people fora to create opportunities for CSOs, other stakeholders and the public at large to participate in the evaluation of activities undertaken by the Assemblies in the preceding year. Actions:
• Organize two meetings between CSOs engaged in local government activities and Ministry of Local Government, MOFEP, NDPC, National Association of Local

This will minimize or bring to closure the persistent skepticism about the existing asset declaration regime and inject public confidence into the process.

,1,Ghana,3.4 Technology and Innovation,"During the 2013 - 2014 Action Plan period, the Ghana Government will continue, with increased vigour, the policy of achieving economic growth and development through the development and deployment and application of ICT. The modernization of the civil and public services through the application of ICT will be accelerated to enhance service delivery, efficiency and effectiveness. The goal is to complete, within the Action Plan period, the implementation of three major ICT-based projects: e-immigration, GIFMIS and Ghana Open Data Initiative (GODI).
The purpose of the introduction of the e-immigration system for visitors is to manage the growth of visitor members in a cost effective way through the use of cutting edge technology and to deliver service consistent with expectations of travelers. The introduction of an e-immigration system will help regulate entry into and exit of the country by foreigners and check fake identities. The automation will affect two seaports and four border entries, including Aflao and Elubo, and will contribute to promoting and improving intelligence sharing within the Ghana Immigration Service (GIS).
The Ghana Integrated Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS) is a charter for public financial management that will help achieve the following key objectives:
i. Capture all public finances currently scattered at different units, at the centre and across all local governments
ii. Produce a single unified chart of accounts and budget classification (for budgeting, accounting and reporting) that is compliant with IMF standards
iii. Develop and implement re-engineered business processes that are best practice
iv. Consolidate the reporting of all government finances within the two years (2013 - 2014) that GIFMIS will be completed
Ghana further commits to the application of ICT for enhanced service delivery through the full implementation, by the end of 2014, of the Ghana Open Data Initiative (GODI) by the National Information and Technology Agency (NITA). In 2011, Ghana joined the global Open Data Initiative (ODA). The objective of the initiative includes promoting transparency in government transactions and creating business opportunity for re–use of open government data. The initiative involves a bold and innovative approach to governance and how public services should adapt their procedure to meet the demands and necessities of citizens.
GODI will facilitate data collection and dissemination by Ministries, Departments and Agencies and trigger innovation and development through the use of the data so disseminated. The Government, through the Ministry of Communications, will support NITA to open two portals, one immediately, by 2013, and the other, long- term, by 2014, to facilitate the collection and dissemination of data to serve citizens. actions:
• Institute twice yearly support and solidarity meetings with Ghana Immigration Service and Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning to track prospects, progress and problems faced in rolling out GIFMIS and E-immigration

December 20123 – calling for a presumption in favour of openness to be

,1,Netherlands,"ACTION 1b: Rethink information management and active access:
four ‘open by design’ pilot projects","To provide good, rapid access to government information, freedom of 
information and open standards must be incorporated into the design of 
information systems. For example, the system must allow non-public 
information to be labelled as such when information is first created or a 
form completed. Exactly what this implies for information systems will first 
have to be determined in a number of pilot projects.
‘Open by design’ only works if a presumption of open access is taken into account from the moment information is created. New systems will not immediately prompt a change in procedures and culture, but they will facilitate change. To put this action into effect, it is important to take advantage of any ‘natural transition points’, such as when information systems are replaced, so that the changes can be effected in a cost- neutral way.
To prevent this action item from disrupting existing systems and thus incurring extra costs for the public sector, the plan is to conduct a number of pilot projects to determine functional requirements for new information systems and architectures and the way documents are generated in them.4 In central government (core ministries only), the first generic applications for storing documents will be available in two to three years

The website shows how current legislation comes into being, in an effort to demonstrate to people how they can influence the legislative process. Among other things, it uses open data from wetten.nl (‘laws.nl’).
A report by the research and documentation centre of the Ministry of Security and Justice concluded that the Dutch government is very transparent. However, it is difficult for citizens and interest groups that do not encounter legislation every day to fathom what exactly happens in the process, and thus to have any influence over it.
Netwerk Democratie believes that the Netherlands must also create scope for this kind of interaction and hopes that volgdewet.nl will prompt a trend towards more interactive legislative procedures starting at the grassroots. This initiative therefore differs from the legislative calendar since Volg de Wet will include background information and explanations of various pieces of legislation under development.

Although the informal approach is currently being used in 300 pilot projects in 16 areas of the public sector, it is seldom applied to freedom of information requests or to complaint and appeal procedures in response to rejected freedom of information requests.
Following a survey of the potential for applying the informal approach to freedom of information requests and a description of several practical examples, a new pioneering process will be launched in autumn 2013. For a year, participants’ experiences will be monitored and the potential for and effects of informal interventions in response to freedom of information requests will be identified.

,1,Netherlands,ACTION 12: Water Coalition,"The Netherlands is experiencing major developments when it comes to water, too, and we must act now in anticipation of changing circumstances. The economic downturn has forced us to be more creative with the opportunities we have. The climate is changing, and we have to plan for hotter summers, wetter winters and heavier rainfall when developing our physical environment. This means that measures must be taken in both the water system and the water processing cycle (the chain of processes from drinking water supply to sewerage and wastewater treatment).
The National Administrative Agreement on Water sets out arrangements that should help us cope with these changes. One such arrangement involves cost savings by optimising the water processing cycle through an integrated approach. The agreement forms the basis for collaboration between drinking water suppliers, local authorities and water authorities, which will be vital for the goals to be achieved. The Water Coalition, which brings together public and private parties (the latter sometimes quite unexpected) and civil-society organisations, is currently focusing on households in the water processing cycle. What can households do to make the water processing cycle more sustainable, while also saving money, both for themselves and for society as a whole? Clever combinations can help us meet the social challenges we face in relation to water management.
The Water Coalition hopes to reinforce a trend in society, and to harness it to achieve water-related goals by entering into consultation with potentially interested parties, bringing them together in coalitions, sharing and disseminating their knowledge, and providing procedural support for initiatives if necessary.",Water Coalition,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment","The Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment has set up a Directorate for Public Participation, which provides services to help engage citizens, civil-society organisations and businesses, and advises on and develops policy for public participation. The directorate actively monitors and responds to new developments such as the ‘energetic society’, transparent government and social media. The authorities are considering how to use the energetic society in decision- and policymaking and in the implementation of government projects. The Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment is working on a vision, a strategy and specific products and services to underpin its dealings with the energetic society.
In this way, it intends to put into practice the Government’s policy document on stimulating social engagement – ‘do-ocracy’ – and particularly the objective of enhancing the government’s capacity to connect with society. Openness and transparency are important if this is to be achieved in an effective and efficient manner.","Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment

,1,Netherlands,"ACTION 14: Make government information accessible and easy to 
find","Exploratory study to enhance findability
Actively disclosing information involves more than simply publishing documents. Information has to be released in a communicative and accessible manner, so that it actually helps citizens and stakeholders independently form their own opinion or take decisions. Information must be presented in a form appropriate to the context in which citizens and stakeholders operate, particularly when it is made available in greater quantities than is currently the case. There are various approaches to releasing government information. The Council for Public Administration recommends an activities index. Other approaches may be based on life events or top tasks (see below). Active access to government information requires ease of access via rijksoverheid.nl. The ministries’ communication directorates and the Public Information and Communications Department are willing to advise on the best way to release information in a communicative and accessible manner.
Top tasks
People generally access a website with a particular goal in mind. The websites of public-sector organisations contain huge amounts of information. Confronted by this, people often find it difficult to achieve their goal (make an appointment, submit an application), or perhaps they are not able to find an answer because the website does not ‘speak their language’. Some do not even manage to reach the site they want because they use a search term that the organisation concerned does not use (e.g. a brand name that has become the generic term for something, such as the ‘kliko’ bins used in the Netherlands; most local authorities do not use the term ‘kliko’).
Liverpool City Council (UK) has already introduced the ‘top tasks approach’, and thus constitutes a good example for the Netherlands. Top tasks are identified by researching which products and services people most frequently search for, and what search terms they use. Those products and services are then given a prominent place on the website. For local authorities, for example, these tasks are likely to be associated with waste disposal and passports. These tasks can also be made more findable by adding synonyms and ensuring that the most important information shows up as the first search result. This sounds logical, but most public-sector websites are not set up like this. Thinking in terms of top tasks requires a different attitude, oriented more towards demand than supply.","Ministry of General Affairs (Information Council),

public inspection and correction of information","In today’s information society, people’s data are stored once and used multiple times. This leads to benefits in terms of efficiency, but it also means that no one can imagine the full implications of one instance of data registration by an individual whose data are subsequently used in multiple processes. The National Ombudsman, the Rathenau Institute and the Scientific Council for Government Policy have called for people to be better informed, in order to put them on a more equal footing in their dealings with government. Citizens should be able to act as a countervailing force. They can currently access a large number of data registers via mijn.overheid.nl (‘my.government.nl’) and other internet portals.
A strategy is currently being devised for expanding individual access to data in the municipal register wherever reasonably possible. This will enable the person concerned to point out errors in the data recorded. The authorities are also exploring ways of clarifying how the data held by local government is used. This should make it clear who is re-using the information and provide insight into what data exist and how they are used by the ‘i-government’.",Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since 2009 the Government Gazette, Bulletin of Acts and Decrees and the Treaties Series have appeared in electronic form, and from 2014 other levels of government (local, provincial, water authorities) will announce their regulations in online publications.
The move to solely online publication is not yet legally permitted for other types of official announcements, for which the common method of notification remains advertisements in magazines and newspapers, combined with published announcement at government buildings. This is true, for example, of the publication of draft decrees to which stakeholders may submit objections. By requiring online announcement of these regulations, information could be provided in a customised way, allowing people to receive digital notifications for those issues in which they take a personal interest, such as matters affecting their local environment, for example. If the entire draft decree were published, rather than just an executive summary, there would no longer be a need to keep a printed version at government buildings. The Government will amend the General Administrative Law Act to make this possible.","Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations and

,1,Netherlands,ACTION 17: Public services and the user perspective,"The quality of their contact with public-sector organisations matters to citizens. If they believe they are being listened to and given the appropriate attention, an effective connection will be formed between the individual and the system (government bureaucracy). Organisations that perform public tasks also benefit from this contact. As users of their services, citizens have a lot of experience and can provide good suggestions for improvement. Openness and transparency are prerequisites for collaboration between public-sector organisations, and citizens and businesses.
A special centre, Kenniscentrum Dienstverlening (known by the acronym ‘KING’), helps local authorities focus more on the user perspective in providing services, including online and integrated services. The centre organises learning events, runs a website and provides practical help at the request of local authorities.
As part of its Online 2017 process, the Government is also working on accessible online services, with a particular focus on the user perspective: if people are not sufficiently computer-literate, they should be given help; processes should be user-friendly and a safety net should always be in place for those who need it.
Since many public-sector service providers are engaged in activities designed to make people more computer-literate, it is important that their experiences be catalogued and shared with others, so their efforts have the maximum possible effect. A study is therefore being conducted to establish what initiatives are most effective and efficient, and how they can be introduced more widely.","Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations and

,1,Argentina,3.6 Mejora del Programa Carta Compromiso con el Ciudadano,"Reformulación del marco conceptual original del PCCC. El objetivo de esta reformulación es aportar bases conceptuales que contribuyan a orientar las acciones destinadas a incrementar la calidad de la gestión, la mejora de los procesos y la atención al ciudadano, la apertura de datos públicos, la participación ciudadana, la transparencia y la rendición de cuentas.
Nuevos Compromisos de Gobierno Abierto y Participación Ciudadana. Coherente con el nuevo marco conceptual a desarrollar, las implementaciones del Programa en 2013 incluirán compromisos (estándares de calidad) de Gobierno Abierto. Estos se centrarán en la mejora de la participación ciudadana (compromisos más desafiantes, evaluados en el marco de la Evaluación anual del PCCC) y en la apertura de datos públicos, proponiendo a los organismos un esfuerzo mayor para garantizar la difusión en forma sistemática de los datos analizados (en su Comité de Calidad), del nivel de cumplimiento de los objetivos planteados, de sus informes de gestión y en general, de la información de datos primarios por ellos generados en formatos que el público pueda hallar, comprender, utilizar fácilmente y que favorezcan su reutilización.
Desarrollo de una publicación de apoyo a la mejora de Herramientas de Participación Ciudadana. Se desarrollará un manual sobre herramientas de consulta a la ciudadanía. Se espera que esta obra resulte un apoyo actualizado para las acciones de capacitación en el ámbito del componente Participación Ciudadana.
Generalización de la difusión de Compromisos de Calidad (estándares) del PCCC en la Guía de Trámites. Se espera que todo organismo adherido al PCCC, cuyos productos /servicios se encuentren en el portal de la Guía de Trámites, los difunda por esta vía de significativa llegada a la ciudadanía (Total de visitas de la Guía de Trámites en el año 2012: 1.183.670).
Generalización de la difusión de compromisos de calidad (estándares) del PCCC en el sitio web de la Jefatura de Gabinete de la Nación. Todos los compromisos de calidad que asuman los organismos en las cartas a firmarse en 2013 -según el nuevo marco conceptual- serán difundidos como lo son actualmente los de las Cartas ya firmadas.
Rediseño del tablero de Monitoreo del PCCC. En línea con el rediseño del marco conceptual se rediseñará el tablero de monitoreo y medición de los compromisos. El monitoreo tiene como objetivo obtener información permanente para los responsables políticos y operativos del programa, para las autoridades de los organismos y también para la ciudadanía, respecto de su grado de ejecución, la 23 forma de empleo de los recursos disponibles, el logro de resultados y la detección temprana de desvíos. El PCCC contribuye con este dispositivo al seguimiento periódico, con el fin de encontrar correspondencia entre lo planificado y lo realizado, para corregir o confirmar los rumbos establecidos. Se puede determinar así, mediante el seguimiento de indicadores, en qué medida los compromisos asumidos, las mejoras comprometidas, el cronograma de trabajo y los resultados se cumplen de acuerdo con lo planificado. El nuevo tablero contemplará la medición de los compromisos correspondientes a los componentes reformulados en el nuevo marco conceptual.
Diseño y lanzamiento de la Carta Compromiso Difusión. Con un nuevo formato se implementará, en paralelo con la Carta Compromiso (matriz), una Carta Compromiso difusión que asegure la rápida y eficiente llegada a la ciudadanía de los compromisos de calidad asumidos por el organismo. La CCC Difusión deberá estar disponible en puntos de contacto presencial y virtual del organismo.
Desarrollo de una herramienta para evaluar el componente Calidad de Atención al ciudadano. Se diseñará e implementará una herramienta de recolección de datos que proporcione información acerca de la capacidad del organismo para brindar atención de calidad al ciudadano, tanto de manera presencial como remota/virtual.

Con esta herramienta cualquier ciudadano está en condición de encontrar la información oficial para atender sus necesidades en relación con los servicios que le ofrece el gobierno. 

Durante el 2013 se potenciará el uso del Portal Ciudadano (www.gob.go.cr) como ventanilla  única de entrada de los ciudadanos a la información del sector público de Costa Rica y se iniciarán  los procesos de convertir el portal www.gob.go.cr  en una herramienta interactiva de intercambio de información y realización de trámites personalizada entre el gobierno y el ciudadano. Sumado a estos esfuerzos se buscará por medio del esquema de interoperabilidad y datos abiertos promover la integración de los procesos relacionados con servicios digitales y utilizar plataformas y sistemas de información comunes, a efecto de propiciar el uso de bases de datos crudas por la sociedad.

Se incentivará en las instituciones del Estado la incorporación de servicios ofrecidos a través del portal y con la autentificación con la firma digital.

Realizar estos trámites en un solo sitio y, de forma simultánea, permitirá a los ciudadanos reducir los tiempos de obtención de una patente comercial y puesta en operación de una empresa, de casi 90 días, que se ocupan en la actualidad con el sistema manual tradicional, a 20 días o menos. 

La plataforma www.crearempresa.go.cr funciona bajo el esquema de una ventanilla única disponible en línea que interconecta distintas instituciones públicas que intervienen en el proceso.

Este marco consistirá en suministrar la herramienta destinada a gestionar la interoperabilidad en el Estado.

Con la implementación del marco de interoperabilidad se aplicará la Ley de Protección al Ciudadano del Exceso de Requisitos y Trámites Administrativos que establece en su artículo 2: “Presentación única de documentos: La información que presenta un administrado ante una entidad, órgano o funcionario de la Administración Pública, no podrá ser requerida de nuevo por estos, para ese mismo trámite u otro en esa misma entidad u órgano.

For its part, the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport (MECD)’s Digital Culture at School Plan includes five priority working areas in collaboration with Spain's Autonomous Communities, and one of them is to develop a common space for open educational resources.
One of the MECD measures in this framework is the development of the Procomún open educational resources space, enhancing the current platform (Agrega) by making it more user-friendly and incorporating a social network rationale for the purpose of increasing the educational community's participation. In this space, all of the resources created by the educational administrators will be accessible, also making it possible for teacher and the entire educational community to incorporate their own content. The second measure is the development and launching of two massive online open courses (MOOC) for educators: Personal learning environments and Project-based learning.

Accessibility of National Health System microdata,"￼The Health Information System involves an effort to compile data proceeding from the Health Services of Spain's 17 Autonomous Communities, the Ministry of Health's own system, and from other sources, whether national or international. This means that merely compiling this data, with logical and structured storage, generates added value in and of itself, given that none of these bodies could collect Main Objective this data alone, thus creating a database that has great potential to be truly useful. The goal is to make available to the public the entire NHS database, where complete microdata on major statistics could be downloaded for free. Moreover, this database will be expanded as new information systems are developed. Characteristics of the service: the NHS database is accessible ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼from the website of Spain's Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality: http://www.msssi.gob.es/estadEstudios/estadisticas/bancoDatos.htm. Files may be downloaded for free.
The data provided is anonymised (in those operations subject to statistical secrecy because they form part of the National Statistics Plan) and include information necessary for their comprehension and use: term glossaries, questionnaires and fact sheets.

- Spain's National Health Survey (ENSE): Statistical operation included in PEN 2009-2012 and previous plans. The microdata corresponds to the eight editions of the ENSE covering 1987 – 2011. The first five surveys were conducted in collaboration with Spain's national Sociological Research Centre (CIS), which carried out the field work; thereafter, they were carried out in collaboration with the INE.
- Inpatient Healthcare Establishments Statistics (ESCRI): This database covers microdata from 1996 (when these statistics became the responsibility of the Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs) to 2009. Statistical operation included in subsequent PEN of the General State Administration.
- Statistics on Specialised Healthcare Centres: ESCRI has been incorporated into the Statistics on Specialised Healthcare Centres. The new Statistics on Specialised Healthcare Centres (resulting from the reform of the previous ESCRI) compiles data on installations, staffing, activity and financial data since the 2010 tax year. The statistical data for 2010-2012 are available on the NHS interactive consultations page:
http://pestadistico.inteligenciadegestion.msssi.es/
Microdata for 2010-2012 is in the process of being anonymised and the accompanying documents are being prepared, with plans to upload them to the NHS Database during the second half of 2014.
2. Application for access and data mining
National Death Index (IND): The available files cover 1987- 2014 (May of 2014). These data may only be ceded to: public or private healthcare centres, public health administrations, and public research centres.

,2,Spain,Commitment No. 7. Portal of the Administration of Justice,"Opening up the information of Public Administrations is not only a trend, but rather an obligation that is being increasingly taken on both by citizens and by the Public Administrations that are in charge of providing it. In this regard, the Portal of the Administration of Justice (PAJ) constitutes an appropriate platform to promote access to the information and services of the Administration of Justice by citizens and by judicial professionals.
The objective of this commitment is to promote access to information through the PAJ in the following areas:
- Promote the Portal of the Administration of Justice as a repository of the Administration of Justice for the Ministry of Justice, the Autonomous Communities that have powers in the area of Justice, the General Council of the Judiciary, and the General State Prosecution Service (in the area of the State Technical Committee of the Administration of Justice -- CTEAJE). Thus, the PAJ seeks to be the portal for all judicial operators with responsibilities in the area of Justice; therefore, the CTEAJE will study the necessary amendments to enable it to adapt in order to concentrate all the information that is useful for these groups of users.
- Incorporation of new services promoting transparency, especially through the creation of this Portal's website, which will include the following services: access to electronic auctions (advertisements for auctions), access to information for victims, information on proceedings and on procedural formalities, and access to the Administration of Justice's Single Official Bulletin Board, aligned with the General State Administration's Single Official Bulletin Board which is managed in the framework of the CORA.
- Legislative process of the following legislative instruments: Ministerial Order on the establishment of the website, Ministerial Order on electronic registry, and Ministerial Order on the Official Bulletin Board.
- Access to the European e-Justice Portal, which will host the actions on open government and open data included in the e-Justice Action Plan 2014-2018 that is currently under negotiation.
- Creation of an open data section, which may be used to disseminate data relating to the Administration of Justice.

Greater control and transparency in public grants,"The legal framework of grants will be will be extended to all the assistance granted in the public administrative sector, and all monetary disbursements for no consideration will have the status of grants, and, therefore, will have to comply with legal provisions. Moreover, progress will be made in the coordination model among the different public administrations. In addition, greater equality and transparency will be fostered in the awarding of grants, by promoting the competitive procedure and restricting any other awarding models. In this regard, the law sets forth the open call method, and allows procedures of continued submission of applications.
To develop the principle of transparency, and following the forecasts of the CORA, the functionality of the National Database on Grants (BDNS) will be strengthened, and its use will be promoted as a planning instrument and for combating grant-related fraud; but also, part of its content—which will be given public status—will be used to make the BDNS work as a national centralised system for advertising grants, empowering the General State Administration Comptroller
General’s Office to advertise all the current calls, as well as the awarding resolutions throughout the national territory. Measures will also be adopted to streamline and make more flexible the processing of grants by the interested parties, as regards the submission of certificates and other administrative documents, the amendments to the awarding resolution occurred during the implementation of the grant or regarding the deadline and the system for justifying expenses in the corresponding phase.

1. The creation of the Spanish Council on Drug Dependence is a measure to rationalise and reorganise the collegiate bodies under the Government Delegation for the National Plan on Drugs. It will enable the reduction in the number of said bodies, while at the same time increasing participation in the definition of drug policies by sectors that had never been represented in any such bodies, thus complying with UN and EU recommendations to promote citizen participation.
2. Its creation will take place during the parliamentary procedure for enacting the Public Sector Reform Act, and at the same time, the Inter-ministerial Group for the National Plan on Drugs and the Advisory Council of the Spanish Observatory on Drugs and Drug Addictions will disappear.
3. Once the aforementioned Act is approved, the composition of said State Council will be stipulated through implementing regulations, namely in a Royal Decree.
4. The current plan is for the Royal Decree stipulating the aspects regarding the State Council to incorporate four permanent working groups and a plenary, with the following level of representation:
Working groups: In all of them there will be at least one official from the Government Delegation for the National Plan on Drugs, and there can be other members from the Plenary (inter-ministerial in nature), if they so request.
a) Health Commission made up of experts from Medical Scientific Societies renowned in the field of addictions.
b) Social Commission: made up of experts in social science renowned in the field of addictions (not previously represented in the bodies that are to disappear).
c) Third Sector Commission: made up of representatives from Third Sector Social Action entities (not previously represented in the bodies that are to disappear).
d) Labour Environment Commission: made up of representatives of the employers' associations and the trade unions (it already exists, and is part of the State Council).

The aim is to have meetings before producing the draft, the amendments or the new versions of the PNS, with the participation of the stakeholders. These meetings should enable the incorporation into the PNS, at an early stage, of elements that may be relevant from a perspective other than that of the public administration, and which, given their nature or as a result of the public administration's internal perspective, may not be currently given the attention they deserve.

This law aims at establishing mechanisms to report corruption cases, and setting up special measures to protect whistleblowers that witness corruption cases within the public sector. The law will sustain the effort of fighting the phenomenon of corruption that threatens public resources, and will reduce its effects at different levels of the government, including central and local level and all structures involved in public services delivery.
This law aims to determine the list of high government officials and who are obliged to disclose their assets declaration in accordance to specific procedures and after defining the control mechanism and the applied sanctions.

It means that we ourselves must enter data, apply for e.g. support, and check the digital mailbox. The Government will facilitate the encounter with public authorities to maximum extent. Therefore, work is in progress to make self-service solutions as user friendly as possible – among other things by creating conditions for better data quality and by establishing coherence in the systems. It will mean that data are to be entered only once and subsequently shared across public authorities to an increasing extent.
For this purpose, the Government has drawn up a development guide for self- service solutions with 24 minimum requirements regarding user friendliness and accessibility in public self-service solutions when suppliers are to develop or revise a solution. The guide will be revised on an ongoing basis against the background of user tests, lessons learned and input from the users.

At the same time, these principles serve the purpose of supporting the many good initiatives across sectors and authorities that rethink and improve the public sector.
The adoption of the principles will be followed up on in 2014-2016 by initiatives that are to contribute to spreading the principles and supporting modernisation and innovation in the public sector. The initiatives comprise the development of new forms of governance with a focus on trust and collaboration as well as the establishment of a centre for public innovation that is to support the spread and embeddedness of innovation across the public sector.

Following a phase of brainstorming including public consultation and a development phase including a camp for selected stakeholders, a new charter has been formulated by a broadly composed working committee. The charter was published on 1 July 2013.

BPS Result 10 is about making it easy for New Zealanders to interact with government through the innovative use of technology.
New Zealand government agencies need to re-think the way they deliver public services, particularly given New Zealanders want to be able to access government services digitally. Customers expect service delivery that is increasingly digital, responsive and personalised.
Result 10 aims to:
- put citizens at the centre of digital service delivery by involving them in the design process and learning how to deliver to their needs
- work in new ways across government to deliver integrated services that reflect citizen needs and not government structure
- ensure digital interactions are easy to access, use and understand by supporting access and use, and by testing and monitoring citizen uptake to inform iterative improvement, and
- build citizen trust and confidence when interacting with government by providing clear, seamless, smart and secure digital services that meet their expectations, help them understand the decisions that are made about them, and provide easy access to information that government holds about them.
The Government is developing a Blueprint to make it easier for New Zealanders to complete online transactions.

,1,New Zealand,ICT Strategy Action 13 – Open by Default: Active Re-use of Information Assets,"Action 13 of the ICT Strategy and Action Plan to 2017 is a further progression of the New Zealand Open Government Information and Data programme to assist agencies to implement the “Declaration on Open and Transparent Government” and the New Zealand Data and Information Management Principles which were approved by Government in 2011, and the New Zealand Government open Access and Licensing Framework approved by Government in 2010.
The programme is a cross-government initiative, led by a secretariat that works with civil society and the private sector.
The aims of this initiative are:
- increase economic and social value through government data re-use
- more efficient government through appropriate sharing and alignment of data
- increase transparency in government, and
- increase participation in policy development.
Following the Government‟s approval of the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing (NZGOAL) Framework and the Declaration on Open and Transparent Government, the Secretariat has developed and implemented a guidance and training programme to support public sector agencies adopting NZGOAL and the Declaration. For the first two years, the focus was on supporting New Zealand government departments to make the necessary process changes to enable regular supply of open data in re-usable formats to the public. This data supply, which uses the NZGOAL suite of Creative Commons licences, is now moving beyond central government, as agencies in the wider public sector begin to see the value of making their data available in re-usable formats in response to demand from civil society and the private sector.
In collaboration with its stakeholders, the secretariat has developed the New Zealand Data and Information Management Principles and actively participates in conferences and social media to promote and advance its work programme.
The secretariat is widening its engagement with civil society organisations and representative bodies in the business sector to increase the awareness of the availability of open data and to progress the release of data and information that is considered a priority by these groups. A strategy will be developed to identify actions that promote awareness of available data, resources, tools, and websites to help citizens identify, access, and engage with government data and information. This strategy will be implemented by June 2015.
The secretariat will also collaborate with other government initiatives that are engaging with civil society and business groups to align government activities and reduce duplication for all participants. This includes aligning how the secretariat measures the achievement of the expected Programme benefits alongside our selected OGP grand challenges and principles.",,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2013, TINZ produced a New Zealand National Integrity System Assessment which culminated in a detailed report that made a series of recommendations across 12 “pillars” of New Zealand‟s integrity system. These pillars are the legislature, the executive, the judiciary, public sector, law enforcement, electoral management, ombudsman, audit institutions, political parties, media, civil society and business.

It comprises a set of principles and expectations about how the Government and communities will work together to achieve mutual goals. These are
- we will respect Te Tiriti o Waitangi4
- we have a collective responsibility to hear and respond to the voices of all
- we will act in good faith
- our work together will be built on trust and mutual respect, and
- Nga Mahinga - putting the principles into practice.
These principles and expectations support the OGP framework for citizens, communities and governments working together.
During our consultation with stakeholders, civil society organisations suggested that further work is needed on best practice guidance or standards for civil society engagement in decision-making. This stakeholder feedback will be considered both in the context of assessing progress with the Kia Tūtahi Relationship Accord in 2015 and our Action Plan.
In late 2014, the Department of Internal Affairs will begin scoping discussions with stakeholders and review overseas approaches to improve government engagement practices.

Level of compliance with these standards in Serbia is not yet satisfactory. The public is not fully informed, in understandable manner, with budget planning process and expenditure. With the aim of increasing transparency in budgetary spending, from January 1st, 2015 the program-based budgeting system will be implemented in the Republic of Serbia, which will contribute to determination of the specific purpose for which the funds are being spent, and how such expenditure is related to medium-term objectives, for all budgetary spending. In this regard, the Ministry of Finance has issued the Program Budgeting Guidelines and implemented a training program for development of program-based budget for civil servants. 
The implementation of provisions of the Budget System Law related to obligation to publish the reports on budget execution, will also contribute to increasing transparency in spending budget funds.

In that regard the Guide for transparent funding of associations and other civil society organizations from the local self-government budget was developed, which aims to inform local self-government on procedures, documentation required for implementation of open competition, and good practice of some local self-government units regarding transparent financing of civil society organizations.

Therefore, it is necessary to specify and provide mechanisms for monitoring and consistent application of the provisions on the conflict of interest and increase accountability and transparency  in actions. In the field of control of assets and income of public high officials, the Agency has faced difficulties related to the verification of accuracy and completeness of assets and income declarations, and keeping a register.

Current protection of whistleblowers is regulated by provisions of several laws and bylaws (the Law on Civil Servants, Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance and Law on Anti-Corruption Agency, the Rulebook on protection of a person who reported suspicion of corruption), and it is limited in its scope for several reasons (definition of a person enjoying protection, the extent of protection, cases in which protection is provided, non-regulated field of sanctions for those who take revenge, indemnity, or awarding of whistleblowers). Therefore, it is necessary to establish a uniform legal framework by enacting legislation that will regulate this area in a comprehensive manner. In addition, it is necessary to build public trust and trust of persons who are potential whistleblowers, that their full protection will be provided by the adoption of the law. In that sense, ministry in charge of justice has prepared Draft Law on Whistleblowers Protection, conducted the public debate, and text of the Draft law submitted to the Government.

To facilitate the active participation of civil society in the preparation of regulations, the new forms and mechanisms of cooperation at all levels of participation should be established, that is, existing forms should be improved. For this purpose Office for Cooperation with Civil Society initiated the creation of the first strategic framework for the creation of an enabling environment for civil society organizations - the First National Strategy for the Enabling Environment for the Development of Civil Society, for the period 2015-2018. The aim of the strategy is to establish a framework for the development and sustainability of civil society, improvement of cooperation between state administration authorities and civil society organizations, as well as the definition of measures for greater involvement of the public in policy-making and policy implementation processes, for further development and democratization of our society, and the promotion and protection of human rights and freedoms. The start of the Strategy development was marked by a national conference attended by over 300 representatives of institutions, state administration and local self-government authorities, and civil society, who, through Open Space Technology, launched a broad participatory process of developing a strategic document, prioritized areas and objectives of the Strategy, and thus made a basis for creation of the document.

It is therefore necessary to develop a complete and efficient monitoring and evaluation system for the outcome of performed activities. This principally implies the introduction of mandatory quarterly/semi-annual reports by all the actors, which would be submitted to the competent Ministry. After being processed by the competent Ministry, they are discussed by the Inter-ministerial Project group, and then at higher levels of coordination of the implementation of the PAR Strategy.

,2,Czech Republic,"Adoption of the new Act on Civil Servants ensuring depoliticisation, professionalisation and stabilisation of public administration and its implementation into practice","The idea of an Act on Civil Servants as a pillar of the OGP Action Plan has been presently realized by an amendment to the Act on Civil Service or the new Draft Act on Civil Service. The Act was amended by the Chamber of Deputies through a deputy initiative and thus it had not been passed through the standard interdepartmental comment procedure, however, during its preparation the representatives of social partners and non-state non-profit organizations were consulted. The Draft Act on Civil Service was approved by the Senate on 1 October 2014 and approved on 24 October 2014 by the Chamber of Deputies, when the presidential veto was outvoted.
During implementation of this priority the Czech Republic undertakes to realize in particular the following measures:
• to adopt an implementing instruction for selection procedure and appointment of a deputy of the Section for public service and of state secretaries,
• to amend the Government Decree No 85/2003 Coll., defining areas of the state service, and Government Decree No 328/2013 Coll., on setting the extent and manner of providing data into the Informational System on Wages,
• to prepare a government decree on a catalogue of administrative activities and a government decree on wage conditions of state employees,
• to create necessary implementing regulations to ensure implementation of the Act, particularly in the area of personal and managerial administration of the administrative authorities,
in order that the following requirements are met:
• unambiguous definition of a boundary between the positions controlled by political parties
and the apolitical bureaucratic positions, which will be occupied on the basis of open
selection procedures,
• setting rules for depoliticisation, professionalisation and stabilisation of the state
administration,
• setting a transparent and fair system of remuneration,
• securing a special protection of whistleblowers of unlawful conduct of employer,
• a system of obligatory training involving beside others the issue of combatting corruption.",Ministry of Interior,,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amendment to the Act No 106/1999 Coll., on Free Access to Information, as amended. The submitted draft deals the following principal issues:
1. Introducing an obligation to publish information in an open form or machine readable form, if possible and suitable; published information and information provided on the basis of a request are in principle provided also along with the metadata related.
2. Libraries providing public librarian and informative services pursuant to the Library Act, museums and galleries providing standardized public services lose the right to refuse providing information which are subject to the copyright law, the rights connected with copyright law or databases, if the rights in question are held by these institutions.
3. Introduction of a demonstrative enumeration of ways to provide information, where except for standard ways of providing information, which will enable an efficient repeated use of information, such as data sharing through interface of information system or enabling remote access to information, which are subject to changes in the course of time.
The proposed modifications should encourage a more efficient publication of information from the public sector and their repeated use, namely in particular thanks to the obligation to publish information in open or machine readable formats, it possible and suitable, and to an explicit anchoring of some particular ways of providing information, which will result in a qualitative shift as regards the possibility for use of the obtained information.",Ministry of Interior,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2,Czech Republic,Improving access to data and information,"Ministry of Interior has submitted a project request into the Challenge D9 of the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment. In the framework of this project particularly the issue of creating methodology for publication of public administration open data will be dealt, putting into operation the catalogue of public administration open data in the framework of the Portal of Public Administration and, last but not least, providing the necessary methodological support for other relevant institutions for publication of their data.
Institute for Public Administration Prague also prepares a training course focused on publication and work with open data, training should be commenced by the end of 2014.
The catalogue of open data should not constitute a central data repository, but only a guidepost providing seeking services. The data will be placed on the servers of data administrators, who will be able to place links into the catalogue and will be responsible for correctness of the catalogue data. Public administration bodies wil thus gain a possibility to create in the catalogue records on their data describing the data and indicating their availability for downloading. The public will gain a possibility to seek in the catalogized records in a unified manner with the help of various criteria in firendly user interface. The public (but even the public administration itself) will gain a survey of open data published by the public administration of the Czech Republic in one place.
Creation of rules for publishing information on data sets of open data is currently envisaged on the one hand within the catalogue of open data so that the subjects, publishing information in the form of open data, have at disposal an instructive methodology, and on the other hand a creation of legal environment for open licensing of using open data, which will in particular consist in involvement into the Act on Free Access to Information and preparing sample license agreements. This constitutes preparation of a solution that will ensure data openess, but at the same time must be convenient (non-discrimination, non-favouring, investment protection etc.) for all groups concerned (creators, commercial users, non-commercial users etc.) and refrain from any conflict with the Czech law (Act on Free Access to Information and Copyright Act), nor with EU regulations (Directive 2013, Directive INSPIRE etc.).
Open data of public administration must be: 2
a) complete – data are disclosed in a maximum possible extent,
b) easily available – data are available and possible to find through common ICT tools and
means,
c) machine readable or published in other structured text format – the data are in a format
structured in such a way that by means of a programme application the required (chosen)
data may be obtained from the data,
d) apply standards with freely available specification (open standard),
e) made available under clearly defined conditions of data use (license) with a minimum of
restrictions,
f) available to users with expending a minimum possible costs for its obtaining.
Open data of public administration should be also:3
a) primary (original) – data disclosed by the data provider in the form in which it has been
created by the provider as a primary (original),
b) published without undue delay,
c) non-limiting the access – data available in a way not discriminating an individual or a group
of persons,

In order to support and facilitate making of public data available for re-use, the following measures will be supported: 
● technical solutions for preparing and publishing data in a publicly accessible, transparent, harmonised and automatically processable form, where possible, while ensuring the protection of personal data;
● establishment of the ICT infrastructure required for sharing to make the current data on national data registers available for reuse;
● creation of a unified, centralised data catalogue, where data structures and interfaces are described following a harmonised model and available in a centralised catalogue; 
● working out a solution for centralised data distribution, including decentralised solutions, where expedient. 
● support for activities required to ensure the functionality of data sources with the aim of  re-use and converting into a reusable format of the data held in those sources, including anonymisation measures;  
● alongside the solutions, the necessary policies should be devised and legal framework put in place: 
○ for implementation into national law of Directive 2003/98/EC of the of the European Parliament and of the Council on the re-use of public sector information (PSI Directive), incl. charging and licencing provisions, e.g. in the area of geospatial information; 
○ for changing the model of financing public administration institutions, in order to promote the re-use and sharing of data held by the state, thereby reducing, as much as possible, direct dependency of the core activities of an institution on revenues gained from offering information for re-use; 
● measures promoting the use of open data in the creation of new and innovative products (application software, solutions contests, educational seminars and workshops). 
Infrastructure measures to be supported: 
● shared use solutions for the processing, publishing and previewing of the open data;
● creating open data applications (incl. dataset aggregation and integration).
