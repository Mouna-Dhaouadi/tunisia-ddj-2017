                                 La filière SI/TIC connait une forte croissance depuis plus de 10 ans. Le nombre d’emplois y a été multiplié par 6 entre 2002 et 2012 dont plus de la moitié sont des emplois hautement qualifiés. Environ 70% du chiffre d’affaires de cette filière est réalisé à l’export. 
L’offshoring, le nearshoring ou encore la colocalisation sont des mécanismes qui  permettent aux entreprises étrangères opérant dans le secteur des TIC de créer des sociétés avec des partenaires tunisiens afin de pallier au manque de ressources humaines dans leurs pays d’origine, de réduire leurs coûts d’exploitation et de leur faciliter l’accès à de nouveaux marchés. 
Conscient de l’importance de ces mécanismes pour le développement du secteur des TIC, l’Etat tunisien a conçu un programme spécifique Smart Tunisia instaurant un ensemble d’encouragements et d’incitations pour le développement des activités offshoring et nearshoring IT tout en mettant à la disposition des entreprises actives dans le domaine un vis-à-vis unique afin de faciliter leurs relations avec l’Administration et l’accès aux avantages auxquels elles ont droit.","Contenu détaillé du projet  
                                 Smart Tunisia répond à une volonté de dynamisation du secteur de l’offshoring à travers la mise à disposition de mécanismes d’incitations permettant la mise en convergence de l’offre et de la demande d’emploi dans le secteur. 
L’Etat tunisien a ainsi alloué pour les 5 ans un budget équivalent à 500 millions d’euros sous forme d’incitations afin d’accompagner les opérateurs internationaux et locaux dans leur stratégie de croissance et le développement de leurs activités. 
Les incitations comprennent notamment: 
- La fourniture des facilités requises pour l’installation des entreprises exerçant dans le domaine de l’offshoring 
- La prise en charge des frais de formation du personnel recruté 
- Une prime de recrutement durant 7 ans 
Les entreprises éligibles au programme sont les entreprises d’offshoring opérant dans les secteurs suivants: 
- Les services de R&amp;D 
- Le développement d’applications et logiciels informatiques 
- Les services de traitement de données 
- Les relations clients et services connexes","Impacts escomptés

Local integration in the Project will enable employment of about 50 people from the region during all the Project implementation year. 
A permanent employment of ten persons for the operation of the power plant (supervision, maintenance, security, cleaning ...) 
Due to the availability of land (100 km²), the success of this first power plant will open the door on its extension to reach the size of international photovoltaic power plants (hundreds of MWp). 
This initiative will certainly encourage development in the interior regions of Tunisia, especially in the South, where the lack of electric power remains the major obstacle to many types of projects.","

The solar photovoltaic 6 MWp power plant is to occupy a tiny fraction of about 12 ha of that land to produce annually 12 GHW of electricity. 
That produced electricity will satisfy a large part of the Sodium Sulfate plant's electricity needs assessed to Two millions Dinars (TND 2 000 000)/year. An investment budget of twelve millions Dinars (TND 12 000 000) is needed.
